There are only many repairs that you can make prior to you need a new toilet, right? Well, there are a few things to take into account if you are weighing your alternatives in between toilet repair and toilet replacement.

One way to check for any leakages in your plumbing is to turn off all water home appliances in your home and outdoors (sprinklers, tubes, and so on). Then find and enjoy the numbers on your house's water meter. If the numbers increase after 20-30 minutes, you have a leak. And the faster those numbers go up, the bigger the leak.</p>
<p>Certainly, sometimes, you might wish to replace your toilet in favor of a low-flow design or the like.

That may be enough to justify the operation on its own, and we're waiting to help when that takes place.
