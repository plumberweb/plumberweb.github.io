There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that might cause false information on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can result in extreme pressure spikes that could harm parts. The results of elevated temperature level can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the components. These and other unfavorable effects from the hydraulic conditions should be recognized and their cause fixed. If parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not fixed, the brand-new parts can soon be made inoperative.</p>
