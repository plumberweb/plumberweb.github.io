<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
