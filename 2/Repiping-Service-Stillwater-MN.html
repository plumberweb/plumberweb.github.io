<p>When a big sufficient source of water has been recognized and evaluated, the third major component of a water system system enters into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. A lot of large cities need numerous aqueducts providing water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>
