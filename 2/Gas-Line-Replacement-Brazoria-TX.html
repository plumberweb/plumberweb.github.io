<p>Recurring blockages or clogs that are extremely tough to clear might show a more significant problem than a simple clog. If you experience frequent clogs in your house or business, it may be because your pipes are failing or they simply need to be appropriately cleaned up.

<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your house. Even if the problem stems with the local system, it's still smart to bring in the experts to limit the damage to your home.</p>
