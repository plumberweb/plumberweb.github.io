Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a procedure utilized to clear particles from the side seamless gutter pipes on your house.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
