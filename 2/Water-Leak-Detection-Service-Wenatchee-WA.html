<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Wenatchee WA</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
