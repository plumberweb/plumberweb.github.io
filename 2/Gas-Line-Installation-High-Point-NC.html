<h3>Toilet Repair in High Point North Carolina</h2>
<p>While you can look up internet tutorials on garbage disposal installation, the plumbers at J. Blanton Plumbing are licensed and qualified, and we can guarantee your disposal will be installed correctly and work exactly as it should. Provide us a call today if you wish to add one to your kitchen sink for convenience.

The type of waste disposal unit you purchase will have the biggest effect on your installation expenses.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The heating element is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. But this particular concern is when you have no hot water streaming in your home. The reasons for this can vary from leaks, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is among the pointed out problems, a repair or replacement of the components may suffice. Nevertheless, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place regularly, then a hot water heater replacement is needed.</p>
