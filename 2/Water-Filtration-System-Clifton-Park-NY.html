<p>We're changing a gas hot water heater in our demonstration. The steps for changing a propane water heater are exactly the very same, and those for an electric hot water heater are comparable. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run. As an outcome, we suggest replacing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>

I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be greater.</p>
