<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more brittle and vulnerable to splitting, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other products are susceptible to corrosion and rust while some are untouched. Particular pipe materials have higher coefficients of heat strain, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and strains as a result of temperature change and ice formation. And these distinctions dictate the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>A lot of backflow preventers are designed to enable the components to be eliminated for repair while the main body stays installed in the piping system.

Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
