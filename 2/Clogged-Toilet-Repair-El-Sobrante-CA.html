<p>Set up 50 gallon electric water heater and thermal growth tank. When your drains are clogged, you will probably start to discover gurgling sounds, water backing up into your sink or shower, or weird smells. Drain obstructions are triggered by wear and tear or an accumulation of things we put down the drain with time and as we know, they can cause serious plumbing problems.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair costs might remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the new heater.</p>
