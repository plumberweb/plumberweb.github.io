For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and split or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the area along with it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
