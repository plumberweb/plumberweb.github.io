<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Bad Smells - If nasty odors are emerging from your drain, this is a clear sign your sink is not effectively draining pipes water. Unpleasant odors are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up collects, it can result in stronger odors, and more serious piping issues. Without functional draining, extreme pressure can trigger your piping system to break and leak leading to costly water damage.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the new system in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal launch while your head is pressed versus it will cause decapitation, it may scare a couple of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
