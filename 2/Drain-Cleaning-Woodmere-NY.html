<p>An Innovative option allowing Utilities to proactively monitor their water networks, trace leakages and pinpoint their precise areas while using highly sensitive acoustic sensors, management software application & mobile applications.

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<p>Changing your flapper may require slightly various steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, however possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
