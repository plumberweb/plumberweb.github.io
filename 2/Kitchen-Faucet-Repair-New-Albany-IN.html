<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our stiff trust accreditation standards.

If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in New Albany IN 47150</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts need to be eliminated and changed with brand-new rubber parts. It is essential that just original factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts.
