<p>2 styles of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be utilized to isolate health or non-health dangers but is effective versus back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>In fact, reverse flow testing developed to guarantee that backflow preventers prevent backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a legitimate health issue, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are properly evaluated by certified personnel.</p>
