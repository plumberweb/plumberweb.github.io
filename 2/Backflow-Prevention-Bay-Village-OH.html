<p>If you're coping with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and unlimited appliance repair expenses, you need a water softener. Tough water is not a problem that will go away on its own and the costs sustained by tough water will just continue to escalate.

Your flow rate will continue to restrict and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout the home if scale continues to accumulate in your pipes. Tough water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your utility bills will continue to barrel skyward.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

A part can even more be broken down into its individual parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc).
