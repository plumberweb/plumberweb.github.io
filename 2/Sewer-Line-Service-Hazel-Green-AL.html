<p>Leaks are sneaky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and producer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron.
