<p>As an entrepreneur, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating effect on your company. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience far more tear and wear than residential drains and are more vulnerable to obstructions and clog. All backflow preventers need to be checked annually by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report must be provided to us.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does happen more often than you think! When you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes, often it occurs at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Every day you count on your hot water heater more than you may even understand. From washing your face, brushing your teeth, and showering, to doing kitchen tasks like washing meals, warm water is a requirement. It can cause a considerable disturbance in your service operations if your water heating equipment stops working if you own a commercial property or company.</p>
