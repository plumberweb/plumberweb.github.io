<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Sandy OR</h3>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is called fouling.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
