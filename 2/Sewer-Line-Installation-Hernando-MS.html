<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Hernando MS 38632</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>As soon as you've discovered the journey lever you want, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the right way. When you've secured the journey lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
