<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately working RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
