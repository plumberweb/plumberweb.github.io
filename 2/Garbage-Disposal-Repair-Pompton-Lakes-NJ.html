<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
