<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks online and off-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions.

The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
