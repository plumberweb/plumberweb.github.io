It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make certain it works. Inspect beneath to be sure there aren't any leakages.
