<p>We'll reveal you three common gas piping situations. We'll reveal you one method to make each connection, however there are other equally genuine ways using common plumbing parts. Don't be confused by the labels FIP and MIP; they simply stand for female pipe threads and male pipe threads, respectively. And when you purchase the parts, don't think twice to ask for assistance. Then screw all the gas line parts together to make sure they fit.</p>
<p>We've already seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the difference in between them? When it pertains to the problem of hard water, a standard water softener in fact eliminates magnesium, silica and calcium ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is referred to as short-lived hardness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
