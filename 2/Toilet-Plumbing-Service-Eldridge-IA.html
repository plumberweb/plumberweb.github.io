<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Eldridge IA</h3>
<p>There are many components to a toilet that interact to make it function. If it is not flushing appropriately, there could be a problem with the handle or the lift arm. It could also be the flush lever or the flapper. An experienced technician would be able to diagnose which part is stopping working to make the toilet repair right away. Is your water heater dispensing cold rather of hot water? Yikes! It might be something as simple as a blown pilot burner or as complicated as a faulty thermocouple. Relighting the pilot light might be a DIY project. Fixing or replacing the thermocouple is a job for our group of experienced pros.</p>
