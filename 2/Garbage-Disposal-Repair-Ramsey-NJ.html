<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
