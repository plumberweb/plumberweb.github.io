Denver Water will send a testing reminder notice 30 days before the yearly test is due.</p>
<p>Building codes can vary from city to city, but all serve the same purpose. The comprehensive list of arrangements and guidelines list the minimum requirements for the style and building and construction of a residential or commercial  building.

In severe cases, it's better to demolish old structures rather of spending the time and money on expensive repairs or replacements.</p>

The guidelines also require a state certified backflow technician test the backflow preventer every year.</p>
