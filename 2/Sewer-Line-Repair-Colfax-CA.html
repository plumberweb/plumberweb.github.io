Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies must be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure correct backflow prevention is in location to protect our drinking water during the watering season. Denver Water will send a testing reminder notice 30 days before the yearly test is due.</p>
<p>Building codes can vary from city to city, but all serve the same purpose. The comprehensive list of arrangements and guidelines list the minimum requirements for the style and building and construction of a residential or commercial  building. Buildings that do not follow local code are considered hazardous and require an update. In severe cases, it's better to demolish old structures rather of spending the time and money on expensive repairs or replacements.</p>

<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to remove high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that trigger tough water. When water flows through a Water Softener, the system strains these hard water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to stream through plumbing. State certified backflow professionals, readily available through your grass irrigation company or plumber can determine whether your devices fulfills the requirements. The guidelines also require a state certified backflow technician test the backflow preventer every year.</p>
