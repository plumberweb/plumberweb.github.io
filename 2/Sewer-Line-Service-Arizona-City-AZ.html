Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean.

Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
