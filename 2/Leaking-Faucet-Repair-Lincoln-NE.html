Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a procedure used to clear debris from the side rain gutter pipes on your home.</p>

<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and mixed with water.
