Once again I have actually not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In truth, if not done it can be one of the most costly repair tasks if ignored. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is an issue, you might need all of your water piping replaced. Once again, really expensive.

The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health risk or health risk conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It must also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet).

The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores.
