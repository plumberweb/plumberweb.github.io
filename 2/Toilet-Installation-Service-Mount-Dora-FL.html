The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health risk or health risk conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It must also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet).
