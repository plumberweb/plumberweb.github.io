After about fifty years, they'll start to damage from deterioration and may position contaminants into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the clay, steel, and iron pipes in your house.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
