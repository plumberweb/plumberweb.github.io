<p>Water treated with a water softener system might not only save customers money however could also be eco-friendly, because it helps cut down on hazardous detergents entering into water streams.

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
