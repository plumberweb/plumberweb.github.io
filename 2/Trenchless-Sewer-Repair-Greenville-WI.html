<h3>Find Registered Plumbers in  Greenville WI</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older system that's ended up being problematic, or just for a makeover? How about for a structure addition or significant remodel?

Installation includes over a dozen actions, and eliminating the old one includes much more operations.
