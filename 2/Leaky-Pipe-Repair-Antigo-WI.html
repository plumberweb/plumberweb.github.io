Hard water destroys devices, leaves cloudy soap scum throughout bathrooms and cooking areas, and dries out hair and skin.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
