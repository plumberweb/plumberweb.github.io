For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
