<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.
