<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Annandale VA</h3>
<p>The majority of houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Repiping a house takes three to five days with an average cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending upon house's size and the company doing the work. Wood advises examining the certifications of numerous companies and getting estimates.
