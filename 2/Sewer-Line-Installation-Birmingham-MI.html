<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for producing a safe water supply system. Stainless-steel blades are normally preferred since they're less prone to rust.

When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
