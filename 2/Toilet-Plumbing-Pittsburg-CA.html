<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Pittsburg CA</h3>
<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
