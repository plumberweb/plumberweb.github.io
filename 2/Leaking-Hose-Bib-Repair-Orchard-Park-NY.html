<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they degrade over years.

After about fifty years, they'll begin to compromise from rust and might place toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the steel, clay, and iron pipes in your home. This might not need totally repiping your home, given that newer products might have currently been used in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing.
