Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are big underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
