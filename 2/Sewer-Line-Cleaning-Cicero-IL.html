<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
