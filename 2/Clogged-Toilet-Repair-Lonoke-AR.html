<h3>Leaky Faucets at Lonoke AR 72086 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
