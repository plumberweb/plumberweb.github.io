<p>When you get rid of the cap to eliminate the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. But discovering the right washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently readily available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
