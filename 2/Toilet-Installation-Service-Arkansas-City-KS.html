<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are installed in locations where water might cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Water discoloration: Another apparent sign of your pipes decomposing is brown or yellow water coming out of your sinks or tub.
