<p>If you're living with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless home appliance repair expenses, you need a water softener.

If scale continues to accumulate in your pipes, your circulation rate will continue to limit and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout your house. Hard water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your energy costs will continue to barrel skyward. The continuous cycle of repairs and replacements will continue till your house is secured by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
