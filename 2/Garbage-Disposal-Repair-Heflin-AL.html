<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Heflin AL</h3>
<p>Many houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Likewise known as cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we rotate on our end to unclog drains. This approach works best for cleaning out drains clogged with hair and debris, such as sinks and showers. Backflow is the flow of water in the wrong direction from a customer's water supply into the general public water supply. Backflow may be caused by back pressure or back siphonage.</p>
