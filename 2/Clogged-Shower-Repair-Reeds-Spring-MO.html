<p>In the 1990 ′ s, dry spell conditions determined water suppliers to execute water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Continuous blockages: If the plunger has ended up being a regular component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant clogs show your toilet no longer has the power needed to successfully get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
