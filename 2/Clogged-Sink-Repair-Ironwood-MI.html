<p>Our plumber teams aim to keep your house and work locations effective, comfortable and functional. Another indication your disposal requires replacement would be strange noises. If your disposal is regularly making sounds that are abnormal for the machine, it might be in need of major repairs or it might be nearing the end of its lifespan. Regular blockages, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, could indicate an issue with the disposal. If there are leaks coming from your system, it is most likely due to too much use over an extended period of time. Much of these leaks can be fixed, however if they become larger and more frequent, you must think about total system replacement.</p>
