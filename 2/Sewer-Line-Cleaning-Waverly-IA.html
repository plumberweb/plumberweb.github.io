<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet.

This is likewise the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
