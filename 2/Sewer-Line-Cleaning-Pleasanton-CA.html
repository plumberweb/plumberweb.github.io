<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
