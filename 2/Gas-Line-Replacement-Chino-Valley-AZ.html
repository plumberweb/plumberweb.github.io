In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
