<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
