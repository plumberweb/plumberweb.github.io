<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
