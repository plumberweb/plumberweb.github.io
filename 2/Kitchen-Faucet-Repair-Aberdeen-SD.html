<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different celebrations, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were fantastic. They rapidly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, similar to each person we have actually experienced with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, timely, and extremely knowledgeable. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either little or large job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; recover the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
