<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
