If you have had plumbing service prior to planting, you might have an idea of where your lateral is located. If you do not understand, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even go into and break the line. If you are hiring someone to plant for you, ensure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the locations to prevent. Your line will be simple to recognize if you have a clean-out.</p>
