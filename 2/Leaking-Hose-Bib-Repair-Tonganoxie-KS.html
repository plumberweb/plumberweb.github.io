<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular circulation direction within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Firstly, never ever plant anything up versus your home, in front of windows, nor near your lateral. (Your lateral is the major line from your house to the city line.) If you have had plumbing service prior to planting, you might have an idea of where your lateral is located. If you do not understand, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even go into and break the line. If you are hiring someone to plant for you, ensure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the locations to prevent. Your line will be simple to recognize if you have a clean-out.</p>
