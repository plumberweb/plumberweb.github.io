<p>Your disposer might come with a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as described below. Both will create a good seal (though the gasket may lead to percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is mostly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
<p>Galvanized piping is responsible for a minimum of half of the plumbing emergency situations that we encounter in your homes around the Bay Area.
