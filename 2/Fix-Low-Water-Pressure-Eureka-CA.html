<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
