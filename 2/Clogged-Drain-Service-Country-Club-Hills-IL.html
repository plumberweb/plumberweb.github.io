Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
