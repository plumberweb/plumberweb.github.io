<p>Leaks are tricky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
