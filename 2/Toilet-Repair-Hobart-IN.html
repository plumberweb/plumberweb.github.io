Instead of dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it actually presses into the clog, working further into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists require it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
