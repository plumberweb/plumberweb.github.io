<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Many kitchen sink obstructions are because of heavy grease buildup and food particles. So, scrape those plates in the trash and utilize the disposal for the small particles that are left. Run cold water while running the disposal and you can count on clear pipes and fresh smelling drains. Explore our water softener collection and delight in better water for bathing and appliances.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, however over time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.
