<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe.

If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
