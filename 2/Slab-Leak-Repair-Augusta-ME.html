<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Augusta ME</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
