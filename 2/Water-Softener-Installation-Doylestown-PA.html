Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable coating, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
