<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, in addition to inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to avoid backflow. The standard means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow.

The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
