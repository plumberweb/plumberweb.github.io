<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Lockport IL 60441?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
