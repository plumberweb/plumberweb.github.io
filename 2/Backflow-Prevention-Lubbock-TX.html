We now have cleaned up and inspected the parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now ready to start the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the parts to be removed in a specific order. These assemblies will likewise need the re-assembly in a specific order. Numerous elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each element is returned into the body, it is important to put them back in the correct area. It is also crucial that as they are placed back into the body, that no contaminant is attached on the parts or inadvertently positioned in the body. The elements should be placed so that the guides are able to preserve their created tolerances.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may offer a fast fix in the short-term, it can trigger even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
