<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Hudson MA</h3>

The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
