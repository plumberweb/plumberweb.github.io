<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
