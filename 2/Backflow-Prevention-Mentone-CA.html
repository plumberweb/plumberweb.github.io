<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that must also be well kept to help avoid leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to split and solidify or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak.
