Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.

<p>If you're coping with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless appliance repair costs, you need a water softener.
