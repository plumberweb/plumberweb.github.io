<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more brittle and prone to breaking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to corrosion and rust while some are untouched. Specific pipe products have higher coefficients of heat pressure, making them more vulnerable to structural tensions and strains as a result of temperature level change and ice development. And these differences determine the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
