<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
