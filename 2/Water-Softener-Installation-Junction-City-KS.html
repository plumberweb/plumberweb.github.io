<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>House owners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage problems. As soon as a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to get rid of any stuck-on particles. Pour hot water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and table salt in the garbage disposal to get rid of grease. Another great technique is utilizing a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>
