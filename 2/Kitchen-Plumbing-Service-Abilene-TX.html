Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
