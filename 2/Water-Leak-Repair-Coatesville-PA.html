<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Coatesville PA 19320</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
