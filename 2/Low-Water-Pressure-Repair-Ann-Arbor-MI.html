<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Ann Arbor MI</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may appear like a waste of cash. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice? While chemical drain cleaners may be an economical option, the severe active ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, in time, producing vulnerable points in the pipe that are likely to burst. Dealing with fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
