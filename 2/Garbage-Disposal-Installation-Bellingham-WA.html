The largest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Normally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.

I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
