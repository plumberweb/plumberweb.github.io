<p>Because of a problem at the point of installation or because of maintenance, water softeners leaks are mostly caused. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated effectively. If the bypass valve is broken, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed in time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal may likewise be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration procedures. A used water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is likely split and just needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
