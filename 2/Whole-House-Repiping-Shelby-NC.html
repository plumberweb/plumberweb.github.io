<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide.

If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities.
