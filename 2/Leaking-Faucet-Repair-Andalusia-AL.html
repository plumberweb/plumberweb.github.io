<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is proud to utilize Bio-Clean items for each drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is an all-natural solution that's both safe to your plumbing and extremely effective at eliminating gunk, waste, and organic material that so often clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, wearing away the sidewalls and just partially fixing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out organic material and eat away at it, producing safe byproducts of carbon dioxide, mineral, and water ash, all of which are quickly dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>

When that happens, you will most likely need to call a plumber anyhow to fix your mistakes, and chances are they will cost more and be harder than if you had actually just called a professional in the very first location.</p>
