<p>The Required Inspections Table shown listed below lists those inspections that must be performed to validate that your work complies with the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Regulations. Please note that Virginia's Building regulations prohibits making use of any plumbing fixtures or devices prior to approval of all required inspections. We hope this list is useful to you throughout the course of your project. Please call our Structure Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any concerns about what is required for each inspection or if you need help scheduling an inspection. Building, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Defense work require extra licenses and inspections. Different notifications are available to discuss the inspections required for each type of license.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
