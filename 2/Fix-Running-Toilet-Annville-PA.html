Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
