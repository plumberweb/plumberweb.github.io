Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the normal kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, searching pads and twist-ties. While some older homes may not have backflow preventers, all more recent homes are required to have them. Doug's can help you find and recognize them if you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are used in your home or business. We can also perform your yearly backflow inspections.</p>

Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>
