<p>If your old disposal is broken beyond repair, you'll have to replace it.

A waste disposal unit might switch on, however if the blades are dull, it needs to be replaced to work correctly.</p>
<p>Culpeper House Services supplies professional garbage disposal solutions throughout Culpeper County. We will present you with alternatives for repair or replacement and recommend the very best service depending upon your particular needs. For double-bowl sinks, the very best way to tackle things is to use a constant waste disposer set consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such packages direct both drains to a single trap. Depending upon the location of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet set.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your house, repiping might take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires total water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal disruption to your daily routine.
