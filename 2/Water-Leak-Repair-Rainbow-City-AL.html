<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furniture to safeguard them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls.

To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, go in through the ceiling below it.
