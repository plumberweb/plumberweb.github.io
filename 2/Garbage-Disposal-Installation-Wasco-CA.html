The installation must be examined to ensure it does not prevent the functions of the assembly. Test information should be built up to determine the operations of each component. The backflow prevention assembly must be taken apart and parts replaced with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be checked again to be sure it was properly repaired. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is needed to ensure it was repaired effectively. A correctly fixed assembly needs to offer years of security.</p>
