<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>

<p>A garbage disposal lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This typical life-span calculation assumes regular wear and tear of the system. The life expectancy of a garbage disposal might be lower in the case of disregard, overuse, and abuse of the disposal unit. Time for a brand-new bathroom or kitchen sink installation? Have a drain connection or other problem that calls for a kitchen or bathroom sink repair? Our plumbing services are all set for both residential and commercial requirements-- laundry rooms, cooking areas, and bathrooms as well as a public lavatory, janitorial, preparation, and wash sinks.</p>

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET used by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

Proper care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>

All backflow preventers should be tested each year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report should be supplied to us.</p>
