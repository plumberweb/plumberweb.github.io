<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
