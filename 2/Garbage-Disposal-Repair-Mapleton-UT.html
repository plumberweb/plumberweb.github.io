<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements.

As the external finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
