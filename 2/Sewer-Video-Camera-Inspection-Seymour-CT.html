<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the same thing, however without the zinc covering. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with wetness. While it does its task pretty well, gradually, it still does corrode.
