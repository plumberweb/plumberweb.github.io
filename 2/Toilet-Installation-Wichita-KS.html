They help get rid of odors brought on by an accumulation of rotting food in the garbage, and permit users to simply scrape and wash a plate or meal directly into the sink before washing.

<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise until the system falls away.
