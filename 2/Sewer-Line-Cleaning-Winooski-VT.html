<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or long-term connection in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
