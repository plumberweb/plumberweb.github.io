<p>Plastic pipe remains in broad use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become useful to produce until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a method to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe started to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The technique for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become significantly common, with a variety of products and fittings used.</p>
<p>The usual solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
