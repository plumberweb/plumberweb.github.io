Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
