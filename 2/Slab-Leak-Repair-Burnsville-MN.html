<p>A lot of demand for plumbers will originate from new construction and the need to repair and maintain plumbing systems in existing residences and other buildings. Employment of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to adopt modifications to developing codes that require the use of fire suppression systems. It's most likely that the brand-new system will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal connected to the sink currently. If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in location-- start by eliminating the old drain. Most drains are attached to the sink by a big nut below the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
