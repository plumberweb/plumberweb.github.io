<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the style of each component. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
