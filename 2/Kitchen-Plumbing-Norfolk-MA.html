Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation.
