<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your home. Then that normally suggests that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience clogs in numerous drains at as soon as in your house. This can occur in several areas and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
