<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.

Links that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
