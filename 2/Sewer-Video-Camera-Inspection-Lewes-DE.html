<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
