When buying a house or flat, having a plumbing inspection is pretty standard. If it's a rental I have actually not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Again I have actually not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In fact, if not done it can be one of the most costly repair tasks if ignored. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a concern, you might need all of your water piping changed. Once again, extremely expensive. This is just one of lots of concerns that can crop up.</p>

Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream might trigger a reversal in flow.</p>
