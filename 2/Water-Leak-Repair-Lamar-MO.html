<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
