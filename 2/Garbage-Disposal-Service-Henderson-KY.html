<h3>How to Save Water With Leak Detection Awareness in Henderson KY 42420</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
