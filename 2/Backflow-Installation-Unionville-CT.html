<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or broken, it could wreak unwelcome issues on your property. A home's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the property owner is responsible for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
