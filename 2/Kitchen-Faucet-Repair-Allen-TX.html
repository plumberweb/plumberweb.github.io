<p>Most houses or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition security. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
