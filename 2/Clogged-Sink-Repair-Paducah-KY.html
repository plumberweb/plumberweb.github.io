<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Paducah KY 42003</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
