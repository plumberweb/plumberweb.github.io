<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
