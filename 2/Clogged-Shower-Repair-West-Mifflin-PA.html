If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past.

Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs.
