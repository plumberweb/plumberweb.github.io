<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our rigid trust accreditation requirements.

If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Next, check the body. Depending upon the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again essential for the repair professional to be knowledgeable about the firmness of the materials so that their cleaning procedure is not damaging. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to minimize any scale growth or rust. It is very important that the repair professional is sensitive to the solidity and type of the various finishes utilized on iron body systems so as not to damage the protective coating.</p>
