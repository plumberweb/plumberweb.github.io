<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
