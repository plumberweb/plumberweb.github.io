This is just one of lots of issues that can crop up.</p>
<p>Next, check the body. Depending on the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron.

It is very important that the repair professional is sensitive to the hardness and kind of the various finishes used on iron body systems so as not to harm the protective finish.</p>

<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in New Canaan CT 06840</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks on-line and off-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
