Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
