<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink.

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
