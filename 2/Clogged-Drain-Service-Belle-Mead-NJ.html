<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and break or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
