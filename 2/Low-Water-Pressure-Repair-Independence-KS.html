We now have actually cleaned up and examined the parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now all set to start the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the components to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each element is returned into the body, it is essential to put them back in the right location. It is also essential that as they are positioned back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the components or mistakenly positioned in the body. The elements must be placed so that the guides have the ability to keep their developed tolerances.</p>
