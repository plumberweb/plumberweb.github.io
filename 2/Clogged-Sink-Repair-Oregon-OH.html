<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
