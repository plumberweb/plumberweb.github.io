Usually, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber. The hourly charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not consist of materials or parts. Prices depend upon the exact repair needed, where you live, hiring a plumber vs. working with a handyman, and whether or not you can DIY it.</p>

<h3>Faucet Leaking in Pineville North Carolina</h2>
<p>Like many household home appliances, your water heater is one of those things that gets taken for given - up until it goes kaput. Then it garners all the attention it is worthy of.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
