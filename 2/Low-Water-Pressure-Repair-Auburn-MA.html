<h3>When To Call A Plumber Auburn MA</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health risk if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, as well as checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
