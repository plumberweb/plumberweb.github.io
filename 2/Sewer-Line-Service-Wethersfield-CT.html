Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a correctly operating RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage must also be offered.</p>
