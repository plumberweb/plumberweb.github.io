It is important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
