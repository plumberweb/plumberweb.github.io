<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again South Weymouth MA</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>It's pretty common for debris to end up being flushed down our drains. Consider how frequently food particles, cooking oil and hair ends up in our showers and sinks. After enough time, these products might build up into blockages, which can obstruct the circulation of water throughout a home. This can lead to a number of problems, from foul smells to water leakages and burst pipes.</p>
