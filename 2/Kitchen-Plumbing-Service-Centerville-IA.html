<p>Spotty dishes? Some underground gutter drains end in the sewer system rather of at the edge of your yard. Because case, measure from the downspout to the nearest manhole, and utilize an auger line at least that long to ensure you're cleaning the entire pipe. A waste disposal unit will last 10 to 12-years, and many warranties cover the very first 2 to 5-years. Keep this in mind when purchasing a new unit.</p>
<p>Another annoying issue is when the flush valve in the tank stops working or wears out. If you hear the toilet running constantly or regularly you probably need the valve or float changed.  Failing to repair a running toilet can lead to wasted water and an extremely high water bill. Water in Florida is pricey so do not postpone-- get a running toilet repaired.</p>

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
