<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Mesa AZ</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water.

A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.
