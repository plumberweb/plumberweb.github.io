<p>Turn on the gas and inspect connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mix bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. When finished, clean the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work.

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and get in the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
