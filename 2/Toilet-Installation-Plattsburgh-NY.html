<h3>Leaky Faucets in Plattsburgh NY 12901 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does take place more often than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building jobs easily the most typical cause of backflow problems.
