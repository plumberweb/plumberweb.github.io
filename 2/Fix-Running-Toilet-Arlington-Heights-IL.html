<p>In fact, reverse circulation testing developed to make sure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow stays a genuine health concern, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25.

The contractor must possess a valid, updated plumbing license, present insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing certification, and presently calibrated test set.
