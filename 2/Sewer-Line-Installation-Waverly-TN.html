<p>Leaks are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Next, recognize that unless your water is very difficult, all the inbound water does not need to be softened. Showers, sinks, and laundry hookups most likely should be softened; toilets, outside spigots, and basement sinks can be bypassed. In some cases, you may desire to soften the warm water only. Step the water usage at the designated hookups for each person in the household or use the following table as a guide.</p>
