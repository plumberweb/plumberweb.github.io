<p>A continuous-feed garbage disposal is the most common type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating big quantities of food waste. Many garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is much safer to have a vibrating system come unplugged then disconnected from stationary electrical wiring. However, some sinks do not have actually a plug-in installed underneath, and it may take an electrical contractor and even permits to get one set up on its own devoted circuit.</p>

<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is a vital kitchen home appliance in many homes today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can manage nearly any sort of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other object jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Used impellers on older disposals can end up being ineffective, increasing the risk of drain obstructions.</p>
