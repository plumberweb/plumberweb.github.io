<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>Are your plumbing pipes starting to show indications of wear? We can repipe your entire pipe system, or repair specific sections in your home or workplace the same day.

Likewise verify that workers' payment and liability insurance policies are active.</p>
<p>Longstanding Clogs: Obstructions that continue after you've attempted to repair them call for professional support. Continued attempts on your own can harm your lines, and you may have a more severe underlying problem than you are aware of. Additionally, the longer you postpone to require professional help, the greater the likelihood that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
