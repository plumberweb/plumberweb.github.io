<h3>Sewer Pipe in Danville Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Lots of homeowners will discover a clog and immediately grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this type of chemical may do the job, it's in fact quite harmful to your pipes.

Limescale on pipes can cause rust and obstructions, which not just reduces the life expectancy of the pipes but puts you in a position where you might need to pay for an expensive repair. Buildup in pipes can also lead to a boost of water pressure, which can damage the entire sewer system and considerably increase the possibilities of a pipe rupturing due to stress.</p>

But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
