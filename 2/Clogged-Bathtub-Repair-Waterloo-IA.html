However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
