<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that should also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and split or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak.
