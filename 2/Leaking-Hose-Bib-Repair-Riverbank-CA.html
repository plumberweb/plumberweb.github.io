Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
