<p>Sewer lines have one important role: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly option.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
