If it only occurs with warm water, you will likely need to replace your warm water heater. If you're like the majority of property owners, you most likely don't know what kind of pipes you have.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
