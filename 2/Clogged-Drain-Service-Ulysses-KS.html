<p>Check to make certain it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the problem. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then inspect it to ensure it's running correctly. You might need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the system underneath the sink if the disposal has overheated.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair in Ulysses Kansas</h2>
<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical circulation in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
