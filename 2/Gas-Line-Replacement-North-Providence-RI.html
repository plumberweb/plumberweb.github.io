Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right method. When you've protected the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, make certain you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
