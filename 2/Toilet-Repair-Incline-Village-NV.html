<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health danger or health danger conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It must also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
