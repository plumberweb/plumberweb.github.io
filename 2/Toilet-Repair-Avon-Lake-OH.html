<p>As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
