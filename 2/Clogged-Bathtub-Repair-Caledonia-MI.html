<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our stiff trust certification requirements. An excellent rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal corrosion, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and rusted parts make repairs tough and expensive, suggesting a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the right fix for concerns such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the whole fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
