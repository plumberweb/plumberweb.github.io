At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive choice.</p>
<p>Check to ensure it's not your garbage disposal that's causing the problem. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then check it to make sure it's running correctly. You might need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit below the sink if the disposal has actually overheated.</p>
