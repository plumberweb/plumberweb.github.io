<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions.

The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
