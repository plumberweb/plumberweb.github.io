<p>In order to guarantee the appropriate operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it should be tested and certified upon installation and at least when a year thereafter if set up to protect form a health danger situation. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water providers manage these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that go through fouling, wear, or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies need to be tested periodically to ensure that they are operating appropriately. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be evaluated with properly adjusted gauge equipment.</p>
