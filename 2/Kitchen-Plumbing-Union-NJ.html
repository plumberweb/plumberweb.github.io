New assemblies must be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in tough water can trigger a bad smell and taste. When you include a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odor free drinking water that tastes great.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then re-install and tighten the drain locknut. Last but not least, switch on the water and test for leaks.</p>
