<p>As constantly, if you smell gas or believe a gas leak, leave the area immediately on foot. Do NOT use your phone, electric switches, computer, or anything that might trigger a spark. Go directly to a safe area in a close-by house or structure, and after that call 911 and CenterPoint Energy at 1-800-296-9815 or 612-372-5050 instantly. Position the water softener.
