<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather protection.
