<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
