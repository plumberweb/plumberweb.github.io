<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
