<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair costs may remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the new heater.</p>
