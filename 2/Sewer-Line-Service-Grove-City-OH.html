This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the external coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a little round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank.
