<p>2 designs of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB may be utilized to separate health or non-health risks but is effective versus back-siphonage just.</p>
<p>You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you notice your water has an uncommon flow, taste, smell or color. A plumbing professional can identify whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure may need replacing the water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
