<p>Leakages are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water.

Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
