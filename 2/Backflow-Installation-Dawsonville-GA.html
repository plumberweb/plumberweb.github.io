<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>

When you repipe your home, you'll avoid the cost of plumbing repairs and excess water expenses as well as enhancing the effectiveness of your house.
