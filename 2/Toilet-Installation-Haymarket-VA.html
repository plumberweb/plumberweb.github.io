This disc seals and increases off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to permit air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Demand loads, no matter what their usage, must be fulfilled by a sufficiently sized water system, which makes up the second major component of a water supply system. With appropriate tank capacity to fulfill variable peak load need, the supply of water source can offer a steady flow of water.

A supply of water source can take many types, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or manufactured ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
