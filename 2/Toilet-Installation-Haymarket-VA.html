An atmospheric vacuum breaker, likewise referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. This disc seals and increases off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to permit air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Demand loads, no matter what their usage, must be fulfilled by a sufficiently sized water system, which makes up the second major component of a water supply system. With appropriate tank capacity to fulfill variable peak load need, the supply of water source can offer a steady flow of water. During hours of low need, the water flow can be used to refill storage tanks, tanks and towers, which then offer water for emergency use and durations when demand exceeds the standard pumping rate. A supply of water source can take many types, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or manufactured ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
