<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Carencro LA</h3>
<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode.

As the outer coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
