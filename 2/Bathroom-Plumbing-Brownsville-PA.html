<p>The secret to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore eliminating hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the service with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of solidity ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
