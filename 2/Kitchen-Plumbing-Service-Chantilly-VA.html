<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes.

We find that repiping can really be the less expensive and much better long-lasting solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
