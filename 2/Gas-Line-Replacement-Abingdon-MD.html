A house's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the property owner is responsible for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
