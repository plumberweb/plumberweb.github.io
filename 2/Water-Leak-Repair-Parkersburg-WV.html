<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Parkersburg WV</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
