<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
