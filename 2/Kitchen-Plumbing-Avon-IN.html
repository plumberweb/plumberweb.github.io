<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
