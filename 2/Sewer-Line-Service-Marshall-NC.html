<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Marshall NC</h3>

Typically, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues travel with the water up until it is in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to remove liquified minerals that aren't as successfully eliminated by mechanical filtration. These products are what causes tough water.</p>
