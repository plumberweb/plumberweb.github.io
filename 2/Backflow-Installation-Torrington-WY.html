<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they deteriorate over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to various kinds of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll start to deteriorate from rust and may place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your house. This might not require completely repiping your home, because newer materials may have currently been utilized in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing.
