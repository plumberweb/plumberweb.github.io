<h3>Sewer Drain in South Park Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Water heater failures trigger countless dollars in water damages every year. Bear in mind that when selecting your brand-new commercial water heater, you get what you spend for.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back because he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
