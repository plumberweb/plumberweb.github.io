Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
