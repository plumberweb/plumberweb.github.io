<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, frequently referred to as "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to obtain consistency amongst the various jurisdictions within the State; reduce the structure's energy and water usage; lower waste; and minimize the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can often get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>
