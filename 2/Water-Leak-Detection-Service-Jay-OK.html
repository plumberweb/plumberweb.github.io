Then install the top half of the drain from the top, and screw the nut and installing bracket on from beneath. Make sure to eliminate any excess plumber's putty utilizing a putty knife. I recently needed to replace the hot water heater in my home and it was just 6 years of ages. Conventional hot water heater with a tank ought to normally last 10 to 15 years.
