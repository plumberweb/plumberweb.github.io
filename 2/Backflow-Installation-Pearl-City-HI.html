<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. Most toilet repairs in the Sugar Land, TX area include clogged drains, which happen when materials get stuck in the pipes. Sometimes, this involves physical waste and can be cleaned up with judicious usage of a plunger. When it doesn't, however, you need a qualified plumber to make it right. That drip-drip-drip noise from your sink can be annoying, but it's more than just a nuisance. Leaky faucets can harm your house and your wallet, triggering major water damage and leaving you with high water bills. You can save about 10 percent on your costs each month just by fixing your home's leaks.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, but if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. If your toilet is relatively new, you may need to switch bathroom tissue or employ a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain.
