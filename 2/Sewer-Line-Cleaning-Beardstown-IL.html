<p>When you remove the cap to eliminate the valve, check the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is simple and low-cost. But finding the ideal washer might not be. The most typical washers are frequently readily available in your home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to find. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
