<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>No house owner wants to handle inefficient plumbing, particularly when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your homes plumbing goes beyond just the pipes inside your home to the main sewer line that connects to them. Many significant plumbing problems generally take place on the main line, and it's best to avoid them as much as possible. Damaged sewer lines can lead to restrooms flooded with sewage, damaged pipes, and expensive repairs.</p>
