When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
