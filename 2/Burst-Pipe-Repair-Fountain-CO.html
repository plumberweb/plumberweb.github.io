<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair costs might remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the new heater.</p>
