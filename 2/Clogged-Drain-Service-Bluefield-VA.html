<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures at Bluefield VA 24605</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
