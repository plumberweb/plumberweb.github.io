<p>When you've discovered the journey lever you want, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the correct method. When you've secured the trip lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
