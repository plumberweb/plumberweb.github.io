Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of lowest pressure.

The need upstream could cause a reversal in flow.</p>

When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is broken. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced in time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may likewise be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration processes. A used water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is most likely split and just needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
