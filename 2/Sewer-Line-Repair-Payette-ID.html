<p>The key to the innovation is having the ability to manage both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, therefore getting rid of firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and online in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
