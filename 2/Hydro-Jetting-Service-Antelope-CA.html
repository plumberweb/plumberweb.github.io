<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Antelope CA</h3>
<p>As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- typically sodium.
