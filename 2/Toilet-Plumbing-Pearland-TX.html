<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in different parts of the plumbing system, a lot of typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low flow concerns and even stop a fixture from streaming completely. The next typical issue that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the offered volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
