If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require slightly various steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube.

To discover an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but possibilities are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
