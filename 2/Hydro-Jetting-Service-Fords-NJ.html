<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities.

In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
