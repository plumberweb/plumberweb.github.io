<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Typically, minerals arrive since groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues travel with the water until it remains in your home. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to remove dissolved minerals that aren't as effectively removed by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers hard water.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange.
