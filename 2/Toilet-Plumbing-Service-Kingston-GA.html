<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Leaks are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>This, once again, is because of the minerals present in the water you are utilizing to wash them with. With soft water, you do not have that issue because it does not have the minerals that remain in difficult water. Whether you're trying to find a basic toilet from a reputable brand or a newer design with modern-day functions, Master Plumbing & Mechanical can help you select the ideal toilet for your needs and carry out a professional installation.</p>

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET offered by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
