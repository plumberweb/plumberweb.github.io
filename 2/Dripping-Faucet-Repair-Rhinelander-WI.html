<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
