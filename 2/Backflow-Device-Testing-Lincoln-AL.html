Once again I have actually not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In reality, if not done it can be one of the most pricey repair tasks if overlooked. For instance, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is an issue, you may need all of your water piping replaced. Again, extremely pricey. This is simply among lots of problems that can surface.</p>
<p>Sewage systems, drains and waste piping are checked for appropriate grading to keep downward circulation. The plumbing system is tested for leakages. We inspect that the product used in the plumbing system is authorized by a recognized testing lab. We forbid cross connections between safe water and water from a questionable source and forbid the discharge of contaminated materials to the sewer system. We also check the vent pipes to stabilize the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
