<p>Guaranteeing plumbing devices such as lawn sprinkler and fire pumps are isolated to their own respective networks is crucial in order to preserve safe and clean water safety. When purchasing a home or flat, having a plumbing inspection is pretty standard. If it's a rental I have actually not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Again I have actually not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In reality, if not done it can be among the most expensive repair jobs if overlooked.
