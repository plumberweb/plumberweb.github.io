<h3>Slab Leak Reroute in Little Chute Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have accomplished an advancement in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface area Accelerated Condensation (SACr) technology. SACr physically eliminates temporary firmness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are major limitations of existing softening innovations.</p>
<p>It does not always imply they need to be changed if your pipes are older than these guidelines. Well-kept pipes may last longer, and improperly preserved ones or those in locations with tough water (meaning it has high mineral material), might fail sooner, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life expectancy estimates.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still occur.</p>
