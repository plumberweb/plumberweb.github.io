<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, however steel eventually suffers from deterioration and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
