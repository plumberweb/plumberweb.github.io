<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely vital part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
