<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
