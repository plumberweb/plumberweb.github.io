Due to the fact that pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines.

You can purchase, with complimentary shipping, a leading name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services below can then assist with installation, or you can simply install the system yourself.</p>
