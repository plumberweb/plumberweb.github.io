He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
