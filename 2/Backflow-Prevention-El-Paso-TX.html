<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In El Paso TX</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Water Authority uses rebates for installing low flow toilets, urinals, and low circulation showerheads. High efficiency, low flow toilets utilize 1.28 gallons per flush and urinals use much less water. Older toilets could be flushing approximately 5 gallons per flush!

<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in El Paso TX 79936</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
