<p>Before installing, your professional will turn off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is hooked up to its mount. In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up.</p>
<p>Please let EBMUD know of any circumstance that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on homes change that may need a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump.
