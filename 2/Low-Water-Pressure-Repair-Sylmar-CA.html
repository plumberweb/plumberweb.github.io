Trenchless pipe lining: Relining your harmed lateral or sewer pipe will normally cost $80-250 per foot, with an average of around $160 per foot. For standard sewer lines, repair expenses can vary in between $4,000 and $20,000, depending on situation. In many cases, homeowners pay between $6,000 and $12,000 to repair vital sewer connections.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of flow in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream could cause a reversal in flow.</p>
