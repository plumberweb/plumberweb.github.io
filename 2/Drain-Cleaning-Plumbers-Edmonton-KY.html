<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
