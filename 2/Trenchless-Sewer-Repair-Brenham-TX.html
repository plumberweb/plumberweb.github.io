<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
