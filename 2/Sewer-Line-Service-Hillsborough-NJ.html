<p>Leaks are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
