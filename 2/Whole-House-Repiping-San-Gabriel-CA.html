<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>

<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber San Gabriel CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
