If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
