<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
