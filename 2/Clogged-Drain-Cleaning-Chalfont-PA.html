<p>106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exclusions in Section 106.2.2 will apply to small repairs and replacement piping just. In structures other than Group R-3 occupancies, an authorization and inspection shall be required for more substantial work if more than 10-percent (small) of a floor area, level, or wing is included, although the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (nominal) of the overall structure plumbing.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
