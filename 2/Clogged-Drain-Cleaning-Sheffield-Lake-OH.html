<p>Also, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more expensive to repipe since the plumber will need to browse through walls to do the job. Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a huge task - and it's a job you want to get right. However the series of plumbing pipe products to select from can make it confusing.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to remove high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause hard water. The system filters out these tough water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to stream through plumbing when water streams through a Water Softener. State certified backflow technicians, available through your turf irrigation company or plumber can identify whether your equipment fulfills the requirements. The guidelines also need a state certified backflow service technician test the backflow preventer each year.</p>
