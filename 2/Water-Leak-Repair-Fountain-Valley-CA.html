While often it's apparent you need drain cleaning (when your bathroom sink is completely stopped-up, or there's gurgling in your kitchen drains, for example), it can often be more difficult to tell if you have a problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Turn on the gas and inspect connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. You have a leak if the mix bubbles. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. Wipe the joints dry when completed. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work. Follow the how-to guidance that accompanies the photos to make sure the connections are tight.</p>

<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Fountain Valley CA</h3>
<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
