<p>Spotty meals? Some underground gutter drains end in the sewer system rather of at the edge of your yard. In that case, step from the downspout to the closest manhole, and use an auger line at least that long to ensure you're cleaning the whole pipe.

Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
