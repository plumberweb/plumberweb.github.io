Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load.
