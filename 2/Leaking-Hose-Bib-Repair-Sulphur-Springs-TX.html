<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.

<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Sulphur Springs TX 75482</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
