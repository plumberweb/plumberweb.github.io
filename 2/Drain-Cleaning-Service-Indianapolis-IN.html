They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the water heater.

<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does.

An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>

Homeowners and plumbers must be able to clean out their drainage pipes when this takes place. Buildings without sufficient cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be easily reached, are at threat of a pipe rupturing.</p>
