Recurring repairs and leakages. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run.

<p>The discharge tube consisted of in the disposer package will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
