<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Typically, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with many homeowners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the rate of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427.
