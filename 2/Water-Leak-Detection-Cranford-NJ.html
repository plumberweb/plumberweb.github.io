<p>The key to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thus getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in large, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is launched, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
