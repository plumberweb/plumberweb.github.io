<p>Stegle says that when they are dealing with a client on a custom house, they will work straight with the house owner when it concerns selecting faucets and other components. As a subcontractor, those decisions may have already been made. We have actually developed a group of contractors we've worked for in the past, and this has resulted in some company that has not involved competitive bidding," Stegle states.</p>

From threading pipes through existing holes to specially designed cover plates for shower valves, it may not be as invasive as you may think.

<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat wall mount by correcting it. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some clogs. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
