<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water.

Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
