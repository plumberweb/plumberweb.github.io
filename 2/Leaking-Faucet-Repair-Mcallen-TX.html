<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that depends on highly technical know-how and specific devices to determine the location of leakages throughout the city's water circulation system and pinpoint the location of those leaks at which noticeable water might or may not have actually appeared.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
