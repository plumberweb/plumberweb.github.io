<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is merely recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>Rust: The most typical problem is deterioration in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is especially true if you have neglected tough water, which includes extreme minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the product in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is causing the corrosion, you will eventually experience a leak in your water heater that is challenging to repair. Leaks frequently indicate a brand-new system replacement remains in order.</p>
