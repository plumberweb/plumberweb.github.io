<p>The concern of leak can be credited to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the expansion that takes place. The thermal expansion needs to get away, hence the need for a growth tank to assist manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force exerted by the expansion occurring when boiling the water triggers the tank to break and start leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
