<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>If you switch on your house's water spigots and water begins draining with a yellow-colored, reddish or brownish tint, that's a clear indication that rust or sediment has actually developed in your pipes and a repiping task must be in your future.
