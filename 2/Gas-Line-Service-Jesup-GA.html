<p>New England Pipe Restoration is the premier sewer repair company in the Northeast. A surge could be the worst-case circumstance. This might take place if the gas leaks around the heater. Extreme water pressure, on the other hand, may also trigger a surge. This normally occurs when the pressure is included and not released. Get QUICK, friendly, polite service from experienced plumbers, heating, drain and air specialists, call 719-544-4922.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
