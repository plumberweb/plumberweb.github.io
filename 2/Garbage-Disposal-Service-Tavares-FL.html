<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- generally two layers of security.

There are 2 different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly defined-- a reduced pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. I discuss them just since they will be on an accreditation test.</p>
