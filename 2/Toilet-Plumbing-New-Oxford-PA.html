However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
