<p>Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can conserve your plumbing system from unneeded blockages further down the water lines. In some circumstances, resins can not be washed of pollutants and will need to be replaced. (This must not be the case if the resin is periodically regenerated and kept.) Consult your water softener dealer for details on resin replacement.</p>
