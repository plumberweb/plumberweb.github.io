<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to consider. Another really essential reason to call a professional for gas line repair in Richmond is the danger of fire it poses. When gas leaks go overlooked longer than they should, the gas develops and something as small as an oven burner can burst the whole home into flames. That's not all, a gas leak fire also causes other gas-run appliances to explode such as clothes dryer, water stoves, fireplaces, and heaters.</p>
