You'll know exactly just how much the repairs will cost and what type of work is going to be performed.</p>
<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if suitable). If your system is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the new unit in.
