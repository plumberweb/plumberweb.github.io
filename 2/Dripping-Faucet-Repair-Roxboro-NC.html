<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
