<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks online and off-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
