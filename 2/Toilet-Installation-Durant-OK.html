<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Durant OK</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>From the above description of the working of a toilet, you can see that it is made up of a number of mechanical parts which, with time, go through wear and tear and may need to be changed.

This is where Matt's Plumbing would come into play. When in doubt, always give us a call and we will fix any of your plumbing problems with the right tools and years of competence.
