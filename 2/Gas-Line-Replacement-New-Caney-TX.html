Throughout hours of low demand, the water flow can be utilized to refill storage tanks, towers and tanks, which then supply water for emergency use and periods when demand exceeds the baseline pumping rate. A water supply source can take many forms, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or man-made ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
