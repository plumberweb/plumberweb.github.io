<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components.

If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.
