<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks online and off-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
