<p>Sewer lines have one important function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage.

<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations.

Assemblies not currently noted need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
