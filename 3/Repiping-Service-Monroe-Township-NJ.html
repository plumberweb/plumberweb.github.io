<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it could wreak unwelcome problems on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
