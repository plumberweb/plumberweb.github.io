<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Quakertown PA</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If enabled to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, along with inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
<p>Likewise known as cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we turn on our end to unclog drains. This method works best for cleaning out drains clogged with hair and particles, such as showers and sinks. Backflow is the circulation of water in the incorrect direction from a consumer's water supply into the public supply of water. Backflow may be caused by back pressure or back siphonage.</p>
