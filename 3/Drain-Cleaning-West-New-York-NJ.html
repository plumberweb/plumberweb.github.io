<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
