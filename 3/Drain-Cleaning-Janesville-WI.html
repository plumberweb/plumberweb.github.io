<p>Sewer lines have one essential role: carry wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive alternative.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- generally two layers of defense. The device allows water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong way.

There are a few others that I will discuss however do not get hung up on them. I discuss them only because they will be on a certification test.</p>
