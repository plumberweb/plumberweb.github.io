<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others.

<p>A license is likewise needed to reconnect electric or gas service to a residence. If the utility has actually been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months, reconnect permits are required.

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

At this time, we will remain open full-time and will continue to service our clients with the same quick reaction times you have actually pertained to get out of us.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET offered by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as a lot of plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Appropriate care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
