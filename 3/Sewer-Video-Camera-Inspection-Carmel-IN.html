<p>Carbon monoxide is released when gas burns incompletely. The signs are the same as exposure to gas leak. The direct exposure to carbon monoxide is so deadly that anyone who inhales it needs immediate medical attention.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
