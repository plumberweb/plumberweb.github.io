<p>Leakages are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>A garbage disposal solves all of those problems, including convenience. Just turn on water at the sink and the garbage disposal does the rest - and even more silently than you believe. By pulverizing food waste-- modern garbage disposals do not in fact use blades - it's processed by water treatment centers where the small particulates are easily strained and developed into strong fertilizer, which, in turn, can be sold to decrease the overall expenses of treatment.</p>
