<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
