Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to stream in only one instructions. In an unguarded water service connection, drinkable water can stream both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water supply. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from automobile washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray advancement might stream backwards into the potable water supply. To protect water quality, backflow security is required where the end user postures a threat of polluting the city's water supply.</p>
