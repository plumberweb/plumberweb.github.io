<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Presque Isle ME 04769</h3>

When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your home successfully eliminate large amounts of water and waste. In time, dirt, particles, hair, and countless other small particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Ultimately, the water might not have the ability to drain rapidly or effectively, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously supporting. It may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate when this takes place.</p>
