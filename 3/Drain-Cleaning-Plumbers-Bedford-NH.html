There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that might lead to false information on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to severe pressure spikes that could harm parts. The impacts of elevated temperature can likewise trigger excessive pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the components.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually suffers from corrosion and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
