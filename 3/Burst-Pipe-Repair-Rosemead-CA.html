Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are ready to attach your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
