<p>Great deals of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are stating.

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be gotten rid of and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that just original factory repair parts are utilized.
