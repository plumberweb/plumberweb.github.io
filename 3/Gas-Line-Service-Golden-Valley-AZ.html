<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Golden Valley AZ</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
