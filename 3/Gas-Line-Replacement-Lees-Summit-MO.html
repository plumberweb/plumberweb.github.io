<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in Lees Summit MO 64081</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
