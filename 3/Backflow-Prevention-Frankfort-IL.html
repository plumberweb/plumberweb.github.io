The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
