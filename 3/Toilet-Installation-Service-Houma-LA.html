<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it might wreak undesirable problems on your property. A home's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
