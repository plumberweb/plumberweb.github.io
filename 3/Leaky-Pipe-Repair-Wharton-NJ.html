"Detection Technology for Pipeline Plugging Based Upon Barotropic Wave Method." Natural Gas Industry 26, no. 4 (2006 ): 112. The presence of excess iron or hydrogen sulfide can inhibit the efficiency of a water-softening system.

<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation consultation. Setting up natural gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service.
