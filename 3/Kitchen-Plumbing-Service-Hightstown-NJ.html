<h3>Sewer Repair in Hightstown New Jersey</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in areas where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
