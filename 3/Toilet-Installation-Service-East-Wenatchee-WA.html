When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI.
