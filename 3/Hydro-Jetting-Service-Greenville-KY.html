<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each part. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.
