<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
