<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In severe cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
