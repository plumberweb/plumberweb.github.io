<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our rigid trust accreditation standards. A great general rule is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and rusted parts make repairs hard and costly, implying a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the correct fix for concerns such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
