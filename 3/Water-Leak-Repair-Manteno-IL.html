<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>A well-designed irrigation system is essential for the health of plants in a landscape but it's also important for human health. An effective watering system keeps the water for landscapes separate from drinkable drinking water, avoiding contamination that can cause diseases. That's why a backflow preventer is a need on any irrigation project.</p>
