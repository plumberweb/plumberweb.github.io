<p>106.2.2.1 Other than Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent guideline exemptions in Area 106.2.2 shall apply to small repairs and replacement piping only. In buildings aside from Group R-3 occupancies, a permit and inspection will be needed for more extensive work if more than 10-percent (small) of a floor level, wing, or area is involved, although the floor level, wing, or area defines less than 10-percent (nominal) of the total building plumbing.</p>
<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater.

<p>Great deals of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are saying.

The piping process adds to the installation expenses if this heater is set up in a house with numerous bathrooms.</p>
