<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
