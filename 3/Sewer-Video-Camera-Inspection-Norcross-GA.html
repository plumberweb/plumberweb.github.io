<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
