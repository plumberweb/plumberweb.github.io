The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water suppliers manage these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that go through fouling, wear, or tiredness.

For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies have to be checked occasionally to guarantee that they are operating correctly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be evaluated with effectively adjusted gauge equipment.</p>
