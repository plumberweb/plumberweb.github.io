<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
