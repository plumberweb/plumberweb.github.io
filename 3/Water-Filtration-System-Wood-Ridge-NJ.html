<p>Sewer lines have one important role: bring wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
