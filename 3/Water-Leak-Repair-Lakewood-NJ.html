<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is.

<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>Pests. Unfortunately, a damaged main sewer line can also result in undesirable pests inside your home. Pests and rats can easily squeeze through cracks and gaps in your sewer line and discover their way into your plumbing. These bugs can be very hazardous to your health. A plumber can conduct a visual inspection of your sewer line if you think you have insects in your plumbing.</p>
