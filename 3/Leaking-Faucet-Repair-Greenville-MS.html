<p>Video cameras are among the most important tools in the plumbing organisation. Determine the size of the pipes in the home and around the home - they will help to determine the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines should be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to provide adequate circulation.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that it is more economical to power them with gas than with electrical power, these types of hot water heaters are generally powered by natural gas. Gas water heaters cost more than electric hot water heater to install at first, but wind up costing about half as much to run - saving you significant amounts of money on your utility expense in the long run.</p>
