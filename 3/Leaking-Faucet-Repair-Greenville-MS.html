<p>Video cameras are among the most important tools in the plumbing organisation. Determine the size of the pipes in the home and around the home - they will help to determine the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines should be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to provide adequate circulation.</p>
