<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a potable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The demand upstream could cause a reversal in circulation.</p>

Remember all these products are concentrated in the irrigation system water, so while they might be safe when distributed into the air, they can be a lot more dangerous when concentrated in the water in the pipes.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your house.
