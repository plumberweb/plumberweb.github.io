<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply.

One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB.
