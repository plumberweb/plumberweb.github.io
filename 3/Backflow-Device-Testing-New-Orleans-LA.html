<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive New Orleans LA</h3>

If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can really be the more affordable and much better long-lasting service.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
