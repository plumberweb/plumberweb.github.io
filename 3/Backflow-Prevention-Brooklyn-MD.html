<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they deteriorate over decades.

After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from rust and may put toxins into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your house.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
