<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Assures? Bad Odors - If nasty smells are emerging from your drain, this is a clear sign your sink is not correctly draining water.

Without functional draining pipes, extreme pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak resulting in expensive water damage.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
