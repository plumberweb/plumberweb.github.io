Constant feed disposals are easy to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, nevertheless, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can sometimes get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
<p>As we stated, a waste disposal unit has a lifespan. Normally they will last in between 10 and twelve years. So, if you discover any of the following signs when you have had your disposal for about this amount of time, then you are ideal about ready for a new one.
