<p>Older plumbing systems may have pipes that corrode with time, leading to leaks or other problems. Additionally, rust or other accumulations in the pipes can restrict airflow and make it impossible to utilize one or more of your gas-powered appliances like the clothes dryer or stove.

If your toilet bowl is cracked or leaking, or if the valve assembly is shot, toilet replacement is the best solution for your issue.
