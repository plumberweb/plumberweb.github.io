<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Murrysville PA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems need the help of a professional. Some minor blockages can be taken care of with a plunger and frequently, when the toilet won't stop running, it's a basic matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank.
