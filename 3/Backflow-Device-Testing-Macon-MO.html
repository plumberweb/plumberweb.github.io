Repeating leakages and repairs. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we suggest changing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>

High effectiveness, low flow toilets utilize 1.28 gallons per flush and urinals utilize much less water. Older toilets might be flushing up to 5 gallons per flush!
