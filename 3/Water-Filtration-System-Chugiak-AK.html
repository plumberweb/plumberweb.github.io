At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
