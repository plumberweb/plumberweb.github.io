Unless you're extremely knowledgeable, it's best to trust a professional for changing a toilet.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
