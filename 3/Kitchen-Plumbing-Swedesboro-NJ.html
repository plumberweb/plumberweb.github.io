<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, commonly called "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to obtain consistency among the various jurisdictions within the State; lower the building's energy and water use; decrease waste; and reduce the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can in some cases get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>

<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that might need a backflow device. Often conditions on homes change that might require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with additives or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your company, they can cause financial losses and in some instances can stop your service entirely. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a little office the concerns triggered by even little drain problems can cause significant problems.</p>
<p>Longstanding Blockages: Blockages that continue after you have actually tried to repair them call for professional support. Continued efforts on your own can hurt your lines, and you might have a more major underlying problem than you know. In addition, the longer you postpone to call for professional assistance, the greater the probability that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
