<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and crack or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space along with it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated correctly in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and reinstall locknut. Finally, turn on the water and test for leaks.</p>
<p>When utilized properly, the garbage disposal is an indispensable tool. Of course, as with any major home appliance, you'll want to take advantage of professional installation services Lots of property owners try to cut corners and install their own waste disposal unit. This often leads to a need for expensive repairs, replacements, or additional maintenance services.</p>

Toilets are typically neglected, but they are one of the most important fixtures in a house. Anybody who wishes to upgrade, fix or just change a toilet should seek advice from a Cal's Plumbing toilet specialist prior to they start. Is your system not working like it should be? There's a great chance something is incorrect with it if your water heater isn't doing its job.</p>
