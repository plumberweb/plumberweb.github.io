<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
