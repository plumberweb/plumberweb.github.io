<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Silver Spring MD</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
