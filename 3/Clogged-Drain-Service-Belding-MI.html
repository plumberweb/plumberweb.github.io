This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
