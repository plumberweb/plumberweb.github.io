<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the external finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

Some minor blockages can be taken care of with a plunger and often, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a simple matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank.
