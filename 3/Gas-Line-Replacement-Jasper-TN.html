<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and performs periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be offered to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in hard water can cause a bad odor and taste. When you include a water softener, it removes the mineral content to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes good.</p>
<p>As a company owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating result on your organisation. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more tear and use than residential sewers and are more prone to blockages and clog. All backflow preventers should be checked yearly by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report should be supplied to us.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly must then be assessed. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that might lead to incorrect information on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause severe pressure spikes that might damage elements. The results of raised temperature can likewise trigger excessive pressure conditions which could damage the parts in the components. These and other negative impacts from the hydraulic conditions need to be recognized and their cause corrected. The brand-new parts can quickly be made inoperative if parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied.</p>
