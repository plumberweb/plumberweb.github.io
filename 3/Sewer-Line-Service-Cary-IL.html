<p>As soon as you have actually found the trip lever you desire, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it.
