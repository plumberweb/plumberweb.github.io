<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs.
