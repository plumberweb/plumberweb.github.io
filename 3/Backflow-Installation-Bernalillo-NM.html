For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from cars and truck cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may get in the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray advancement might stream in reverse into the potable water system. To protect water quality, backflow defense is required where the end user positions a risk of contaminating the city's supply of water.</p>
