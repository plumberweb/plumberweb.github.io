<p>Protect your house from leaks. When you need a water heater replacement, there are a number of things that you need to consider to help you choose.

In this manner you will not have a surprise cost on your hands when the day comes that it quits working.</p>
<p>A malfunctioning garbage disposal, grease accumulation, accumulated food and more can all contribute to a clogged kitchen sink.
