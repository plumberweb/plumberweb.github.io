Tough water ruins appliances, leaves filmy soap scum across kitchen areas and restrooms, and dries hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States relying on difficult water for their cooking, bathing, and cleaning, water softeners serve a crucial function.

Harmed sewer lines can lead to bathrooms flooded with sewage, damaged pipes, and pricey repairs.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to go into the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
