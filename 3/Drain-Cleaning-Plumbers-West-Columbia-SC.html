<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation consultation. Installing natural gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service.
