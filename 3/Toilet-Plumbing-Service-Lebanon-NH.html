The most typical washers are frequently available at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be hard to find. Remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.
