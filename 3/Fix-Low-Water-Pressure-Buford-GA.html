<p>You can relax and use your gas piping without any worry when we manage your gas or propane pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can consume to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth process. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
