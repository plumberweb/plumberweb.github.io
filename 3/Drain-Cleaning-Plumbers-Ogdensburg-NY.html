<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Ogdensburg NY</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Another way to deal with a clog is by using a chemical cleaning product or if you fear they might be too extreme on your pipes, you can attempt old home remedies like warm water, vinegar, and baking soda.
