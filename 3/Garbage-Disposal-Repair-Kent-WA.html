<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the style of each part. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the element, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
