<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that result. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
