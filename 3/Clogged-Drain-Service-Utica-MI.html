Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
