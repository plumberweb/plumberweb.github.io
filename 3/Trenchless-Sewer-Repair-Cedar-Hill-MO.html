<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: bring wastewater out of a home or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the problem became worse. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly choice.</p>

It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on really slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system.
