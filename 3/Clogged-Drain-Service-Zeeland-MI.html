<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that ought to likewise be well kept to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and crack or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place.
