<p>The Required Inspections Table revealed below lists those inspections that should be performed to confirm that your work complies with the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Regulations. Please note that Virginia's Building regulations restricts the use of any plumbing fixtures or equipment prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is helpful to you throughout the course of your task. Please call our Structure Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any concerns about what is required for each inspection or if you need help scheduling an inspection. Structure, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Protection work need extra permits and inspections. Separate notices are readily available to discuss the inspections required for each type of license.</p>
<p>When it comes to plumbing and maintenance, sewer video inspection is among the best ways to remain ahead of the video game. This detailed inspection can reveal serious problems with your sewer line you may not observe until it's far too late. Using this technology, you see a walk-through view of the inner-workings of your pipes, and the Seatown Electric Plumbing Heating and Air group can better choose how to remedy your problems. Our Seattle, WA group is relied on for electrical and HVAC work, so you know our plumbing services will be reliable also.</p>
<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Houses that were built prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not wish to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>An odd gurgling sound when your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never a good sign. Don't depend on a plunger to fix the problem-- depend upon your plumber for sewer line repair. As we have actually specified before backflow prevention devices and assemblies reduce pressure and volume offered to the life safety and residential or commercial property protection systems.  Many fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Typically, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating mechanism, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
