<p>Leakages are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.
