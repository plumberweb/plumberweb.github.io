<p>A newly set up water heater must not produce unusual noises, but it will start to create rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things get worse drastically for families with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. A water heater replacement might be necessary if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
