<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical.

Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the maintaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
