<p>We're changing a natural gas water heater in our presentation. The steps for changing a lp hot water heater are exactly the very same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run. As a result, we suggest replacing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>

So we recommend installing or repairing water pressure regulators to protect your entire home.</p>
