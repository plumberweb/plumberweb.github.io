<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
