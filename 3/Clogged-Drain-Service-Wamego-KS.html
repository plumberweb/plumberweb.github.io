<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is happy to use Bio-Clean products for every drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is an all-natural option that's both safe to your plumbing and incredibly reliable at eliminating gunk, waste, and natural material that so typically congests your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and only partly fixing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out organic product and gnaw at it, creating harmless byproducts of carbon mineral, dioxide, and water ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>As an utility company that supplies important public services, our focus is on ensuring the continued reliability and safety of our service to customers, in addition to the health and safety of our workers.
