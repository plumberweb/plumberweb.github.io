<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is stored and combined with water. , if you prepare to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).
