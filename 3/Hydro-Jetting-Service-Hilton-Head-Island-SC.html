<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
