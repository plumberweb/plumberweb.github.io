<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
