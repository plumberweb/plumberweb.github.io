<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
