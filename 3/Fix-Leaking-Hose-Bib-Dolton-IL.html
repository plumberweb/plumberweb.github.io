<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is among the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it could wreak unwanted concerns on your home. A house's service line (also called a sewer lateral) ranges from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the property owner is accountable for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Excepting emergencies, all permits must be secured before work commences. All inspections should be organized immediately. The permit holder is responsible for scheduling inspection of completed work. Is your existing kitchen sink missing out on a garbage disposal? Or possibly you have actually had us replace your old kitchen sink and need a new disposal for it.
