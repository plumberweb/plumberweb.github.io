<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
