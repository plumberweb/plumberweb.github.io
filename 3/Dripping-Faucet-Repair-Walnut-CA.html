<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Walnut CA 91789?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
