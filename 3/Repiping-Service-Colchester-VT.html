<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Longstanding Blockages: Obstructions that continue after you've attempted to repair them require professional assistance. Continued attempts on your own can damage your lines, and you may have a more severe underlying problem than you are aware of.
