If there is a leak, one thing to understand about gas lines is they can be extremely unsafe. While gas leakages are rare, you need to leave the building instantly if you discover a smell like rotten eggs in your property. A gas leak can have nearly instant results on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. If you have actually got a gas pipe leaking, leave the house and call us right away.</p>

<p>Sewer lines are damaged for a variety of factors. Pipe products can rust in time. There could have been physical damages resulting from a repaving of a sidewalk or driveway.
