<p>These are all indications that your unit need to be inspected by a plumber.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
