<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation instructions within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
