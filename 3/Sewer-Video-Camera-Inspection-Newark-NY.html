General contractor overhead and markup for arranging and monitoring the Garbage Disposal Installation. Add 13% to 22% to the overall cost above if a general contractor will supervise this task.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger problem to analyze. If your toilet is fairly new, you might need to change toilet tissue or work with a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing firms to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise maintains a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>

<p>Your disposer might include a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as described below. Both will develop a great seal (though the gasket might lead to small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
<p>You have most likely seen drain cleaner products on the shelves at your local home enhancement shop, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining pipes water like it should, you might be lured to head down there and choose some up to fix it by yourself.
