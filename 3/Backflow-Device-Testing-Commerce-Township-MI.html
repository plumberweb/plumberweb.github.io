<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and counts on an excellent balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently. If your showers become disappointing, or it seems little to no water is draining of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the home and the variety of restrooms and plumbing components-- utility room, wet bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to access to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your final expenses.</p>
<p>Main sewer repair includes extensive excavation, shoring up supporting walls, getting rid of and relaying pipe and connections, backfilling, and installing plates for temporary cover.
