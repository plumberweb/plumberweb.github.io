<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
