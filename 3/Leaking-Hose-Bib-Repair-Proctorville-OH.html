<p>An evaluation of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly must then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that might cause incorrect data on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause extreme pressure spikes that could harm elements. The results of elevated temperature can also trigger excessive pressure conditions which could harm the parts in the elements. These and other unfavorable effects from the hydraulic conditions must be acknowledged and their cause corrected. If parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not fixed, the new parts can soon be made inoperative.</p>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be eliminated and changed with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that only initial factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
