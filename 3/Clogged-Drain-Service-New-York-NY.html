<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have achieved an advancement in water softening treatment utilizing a proprietary Surface area Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically eliminates short-lived hardness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are significant constraints of existing softening technologies.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>

<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in New York NY 10025</h3>
<p>Discussing whether to repair or replace your water heater? Our experts will provide you an honest recommendation. In basic, older water heaters (over 8-10 years) experiencing recurring problems are much better off being changed. A newer, more efficient hot water heater will conserve you in repair costs and energy gradually. Old-fashioned water softeners are notorious for triggering a spike in the rate of your month-to-month utility expenses. Many require large quantities of water and can be pricey for the electrical power expense, however the NuvoH2O system is different. Our saltless H2O conditioning system uses up to 4x less water than others and requires no electricity.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in large, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
