<p>Leakages are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
