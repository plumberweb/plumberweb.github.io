<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
