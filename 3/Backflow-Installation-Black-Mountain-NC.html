However, there are many disadvantages to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
