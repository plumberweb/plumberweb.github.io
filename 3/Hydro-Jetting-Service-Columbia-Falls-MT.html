<p>For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can trigger deterioration that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
