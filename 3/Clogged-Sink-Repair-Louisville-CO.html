Bio-Clean is an all-natural service that's both safe to your plumbing and extremely efficient at removing gunk, waste, and natural material that so often congests your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and just partly fixing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively look for natural product and eat away at it, creating safe byproducts of carbon dioxide, mineral, and water ash, all of which are quickly dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
