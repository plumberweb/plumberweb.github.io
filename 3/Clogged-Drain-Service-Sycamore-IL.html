This device includes no less than five individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.
