<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of flow in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just flow in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream could cause a reversal in flow.</p>

<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Livingston CA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>A water softening system might not be the best solution for each property owner, especially if you're just looking to improve particular aspects of your water, like the taste, instead of dealing with hardness in general.
