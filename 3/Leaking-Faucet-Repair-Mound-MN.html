<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.
