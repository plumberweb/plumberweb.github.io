<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it really pushes into the obstruction, working further into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea assists force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems generally are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.
