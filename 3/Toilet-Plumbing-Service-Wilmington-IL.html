<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Wilmington IL</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>It's pretty common for debris to end up being flushed down our drains. Consider how typically food particles, cooking oil and hair ends up in our showers and sinks. After adequate time, these products might build up into obstructions, which can obstruct the flow of water throughout a house. This can result in numerous problems, from foul stinks to water leakages and burst pipes.</p>
