<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Mequon WI 53092?</h3>

When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
