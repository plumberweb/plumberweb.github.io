<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Reeds Spring MO 65737</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
