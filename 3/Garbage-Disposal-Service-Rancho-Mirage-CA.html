<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
