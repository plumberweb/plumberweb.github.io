<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Centreville MD 21617?</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components.

Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
