<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it does not always indicate they need to be replaced. Properly maintained pipes may last longer, and improperly maintained ones or those in locations with difficult water (indicating it has high mineral material), might stop working sooner, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who supplied the lifespan estimates.</p>

In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
