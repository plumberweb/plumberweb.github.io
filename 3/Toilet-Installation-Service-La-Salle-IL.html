This device includes no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.
