Once the FutureSoft water softener is installed, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This does not indicate it's not working.

Water softener systems use resin beads that draw in and connect salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
