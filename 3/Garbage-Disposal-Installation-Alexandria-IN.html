For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be installed and a feasible source of gas developed. Another feature of an electric water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be ventilated properly utilizing vents and ducts in order to operate correctly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
