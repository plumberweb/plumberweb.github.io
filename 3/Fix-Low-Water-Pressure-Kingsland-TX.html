<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler generally are set up in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).
