Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper way. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are ready to connect your flapper, ensure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
