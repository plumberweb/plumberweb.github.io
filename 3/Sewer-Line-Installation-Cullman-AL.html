<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really important part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
