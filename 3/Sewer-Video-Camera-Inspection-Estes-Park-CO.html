<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly alternative.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health danger if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>

Your line will be easy to determine if you have a clean-out.</p>
