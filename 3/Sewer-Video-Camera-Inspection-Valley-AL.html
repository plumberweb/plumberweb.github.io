Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right way. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are all set to attach your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
