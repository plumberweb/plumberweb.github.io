<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl.
