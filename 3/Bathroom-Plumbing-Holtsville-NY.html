<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
