When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
