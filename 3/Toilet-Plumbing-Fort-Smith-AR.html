<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Fort Smith AR</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Toilet replacements and repairs are a natural part of being a homeowner. If you wait too long to call a plumber for toilet repairs, you could sustain a lot more costly home damage.
