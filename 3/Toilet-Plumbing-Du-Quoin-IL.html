No, it is not a regular event, but it does occur more frequently than you think! Frequently it happens during the night when you don't discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
