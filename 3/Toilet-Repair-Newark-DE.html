Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
