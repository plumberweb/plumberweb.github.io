An atmospheric vacuum breaker, likewise called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. This disc increases and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to permit air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>These are all indications that your unit ought to be examined by a plumber.
