<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some houses were allowed to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home. Typically, the supply of water to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
