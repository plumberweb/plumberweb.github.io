Our waste disposal unit repair technicians can identify any problem that might occur with your system, and we can help you choose between repair and replacement.

<p>When you've discovered the trip lever you desire, all you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct method. When you've protected the trip lever and are all set to link your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
