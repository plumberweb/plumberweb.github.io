<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating impact on your company. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience much more tear and use than residential drains and are more vulnerable to clogs and clog. All backflow preventers must be tested each year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report must be offered to us.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
