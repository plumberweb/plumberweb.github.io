Unpleasant odors are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up builds up, it can cause more powerful smells, and more serious piping problems. Without functional draining pipes, extreme pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak leading to pricey water damage.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
