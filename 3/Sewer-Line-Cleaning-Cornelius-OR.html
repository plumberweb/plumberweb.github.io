The most popular and standard design of water heaters in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's communities is a gas or electric storage tank unit.

To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, however chances are you'll find among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
