<p>The issue of leak can be credited to any number of factors which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank must have some room to account for the expansion that takes place when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to get away, hence the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force put in by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to crack and begin leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
