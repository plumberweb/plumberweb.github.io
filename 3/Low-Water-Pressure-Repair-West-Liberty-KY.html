<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health threat if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
<h3>Water Leak Repair in West Liberty Kentucky</h2>
<p>If you're living with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless home appliance repair bills, you need a water softener. Hard water is not an issue that will go away on its own and the costs incurred by tough water will just continue to escalate. With a water softener, home appliances will inevitably fail quicker than their expected life-span. If scale continues to accumulate in your pipes, your circulation rate will continue to restrict and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout the house. Tough water devastations water heaters, and without a softener, your utility expenses will continue to barrel skyward. If your water system is hard, the perpetual cycle of replacements and repairs will continue until your house is safeguarded by a water softener.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is entirely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often becomes destructive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the green and blue spots being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and go into the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
