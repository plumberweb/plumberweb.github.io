<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques in Wichita Falls TX 76308</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
