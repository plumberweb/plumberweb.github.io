<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in big, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>

Rust can literally consume a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer.
