<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
