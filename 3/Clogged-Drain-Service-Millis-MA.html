<p>A freshly set up water heater need to not produce strange sounds, but it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder with time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things intensify dramatically for homes with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. A water heater replacement may be needed if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older unit that's ended up being frustrating, or just for a makeover? How about for a building addition or major remodel?
