Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get replaced when repiped.</p>
<p>Commercial plumbing systems are different from and, typically, more complicated than residential ones. As such, their problems need to be dealt with by expert commercial plumbing contractors with extensive understanding and appropriate resources for repairing plumbing concerns.
