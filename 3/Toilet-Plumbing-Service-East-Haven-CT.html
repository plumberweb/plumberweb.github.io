<p>Video cameras are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing organisation. Identify the size of the water pipes in the house and around the house - they will help to determine the water pressure that you'll have.

The pipes themselves must be at least a 1/2" in size to provide adequate circulation.</p>
<p>Check to make sure it's not your waste disposal unit that's causing the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then check it to make certain it's running properly. If the disposal has actually overheated, you may need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit below the sink.</p>
