<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are primarily time related. If whatever is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the overall expenses. Most plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
