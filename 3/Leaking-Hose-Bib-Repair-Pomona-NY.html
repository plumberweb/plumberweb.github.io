<p>Lots of property owners will notice a clog and immediately grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner.

Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with.
