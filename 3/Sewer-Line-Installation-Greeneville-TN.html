<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a viable option, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
