<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Local or state federal government usually enforces backflow prevention. Consult your local jurisdiction on backflow prevention requirement and gadgets. In a watering system, backflow has two causes: back siphonage or back pressure.

If the utility has been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months, reconnect licenses are required. The license cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection expenses.
