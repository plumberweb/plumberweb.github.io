<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly cause countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all types of work.
