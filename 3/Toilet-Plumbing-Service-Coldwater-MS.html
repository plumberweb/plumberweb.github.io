<p>If you're coping with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless appliance repair costs, you need a water softener.

Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
