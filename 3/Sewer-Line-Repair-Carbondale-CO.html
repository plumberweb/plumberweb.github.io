<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters need to have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Suggestion: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen up the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are degrading slowly from the inside. Most of the times, repiping is your only viable alternative.</p>
