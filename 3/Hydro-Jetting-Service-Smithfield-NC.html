<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are harmless, but with time they develop and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to travel through.

This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, leading to the strange noises originating from your sink.</p>
