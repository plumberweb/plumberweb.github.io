Most of the Valley in fact has a few of the worst water in the country. We rank 3rd for the absolute worst water in the country according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do reside in a desert after all. In fact the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even drink has a chlorine level that is ideal for swimming pools. We have 300% more chemicals that go beyond nationwide health standards, and a even high percentage of contaminants in our water that the nationwide average. On top of that our typical water solidity level is between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simplicity reasons "extremely hard water".</p>
<p>Every toilet blockages once in awhile. How often a toilet blockages depends on the strength of its flush, the cleanliness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush. If your toilet blocks more than as soon as a month-or even once a week!- it's probably because mineral deposits have actually built up around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>
