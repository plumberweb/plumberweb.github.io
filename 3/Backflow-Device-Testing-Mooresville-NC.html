<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Any home appliance that uses water, from small coffee pots to large refrigerators, functions more effectively in a home with softened water. This is since there's no limescale accumulation to hinder transferring heat or clogging pipes. Improved performance also implies that you'll take pleasure in a decline in your energy costs, as your appliances will not need to work more difficult or utilize more water in order to operate at their best.</p>
