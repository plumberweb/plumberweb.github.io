<p>106.2.2.1 Other than Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exclusions in Area 106.2.2 shall be applicable to minor repairs and replacement piping only. In structures aside from Group R-3 tenancies, an authorization and inspection will be required for more extensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor wing, area, or level is involved, although the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (small) of the overall structure plumbing.</p>
<p>Once you've found the trip lever you want, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right way. When you've secured the trip lever and are ready to attach your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
