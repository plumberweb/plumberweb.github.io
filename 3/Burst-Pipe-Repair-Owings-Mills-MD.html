Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each component. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities.
