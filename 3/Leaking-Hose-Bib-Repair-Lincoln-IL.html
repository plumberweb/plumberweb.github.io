<p>CPM Plumbing concentrates on swift service, precise troubleshooting, and precision repairs so your service never needs to struggle with downtime. To keep your sink smelling fresh and running clear, pour in equal parts of vinegar and baking soda on a regular basis. For routine cleaning, you'll simply need about one-half cup of each.
