<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in different parts of the plumbing system, the majority of commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow issues or perhaps stop a fixture from flowing entirely. The next common issue that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it decreases the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is tight and intact, without any signs of leakage, you can probably leave it in place. Opportunities are excellent that the installing brackets on the new system will fit simply great. To find out, remove the old disposal and install the brand-new flange on it. You can install the brand-new disposal using the old flange if it fits.</p>
