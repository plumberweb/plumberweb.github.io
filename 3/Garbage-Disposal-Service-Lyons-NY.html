The best you can hope for is to find out quickly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running underneath your home's foundation. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out below your house, a sinkhole will trigger the structure to shift and develop cracks. In this case, you'll need professional plumbers in addition to foundation repair experts.</p>
