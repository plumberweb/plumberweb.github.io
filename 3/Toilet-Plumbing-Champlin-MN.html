<p>Water heaters can be a pricey financial investment for homeowners that they cope with for over a decade.

<p>Depending upon the degree of the clog, we might use a variety of various techniques, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative kind of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to completely clean out whatever inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and eliminate the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and get rid of wire connectors. Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp connector and eliminate wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>

Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the maintaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
