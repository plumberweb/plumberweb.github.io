In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Continuous obstructions: If the plunger has ended up being a routine fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous blockages show your toilet no longer has the power required to successfully get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Observing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your home? Water pressure in the house is similar to blood pressure in the body - it needs to be controlled to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can result in emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is FAR MORE cost-efficient than mold remediation or changing floor covering or drywall! So we recommend setting up or fixing water pressure regulators to safeguard your entire home.</p>
