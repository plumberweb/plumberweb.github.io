<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage only for non-health danger or health risk conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>
