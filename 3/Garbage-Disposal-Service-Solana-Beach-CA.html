<p>Offered there isn't a tank failure, typically a commercial hot water heater can be repaired, but is it worth fixing? Only after addressing the following concerns should you answer repair or replace. Do you know the number of years of ages your hot water heater is? Do you know how many years it's rated for? Think about replacement instead of repair if it is close to the number of years the water heater was rated for.</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical service, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
