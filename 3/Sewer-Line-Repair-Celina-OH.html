<p>These valves have a great deal of flexibility. They're the least pricey of the backflow prevention choices, but they also offer the least amount of security. A climatic vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. This disc increases and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to enable air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
