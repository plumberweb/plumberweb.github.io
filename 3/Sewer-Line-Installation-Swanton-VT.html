<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally salt or often potassium).</p>
