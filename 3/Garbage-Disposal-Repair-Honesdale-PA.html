<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>Additionally, there could be a crack in the porcelain, either the tank or the toilet bowl itself. Horseshoe Bay guidelines require that watering systems which do not inject chemicals must have their backflow preventer tested upon installation and then every 5 years afterward.
