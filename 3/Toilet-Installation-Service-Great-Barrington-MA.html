Keeping tabs on the status of your system is a fundamental part of being a house owner. Left ignored, sewer line problems can cost countless dollars in repairs and damage to your home.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
