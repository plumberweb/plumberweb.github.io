<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
