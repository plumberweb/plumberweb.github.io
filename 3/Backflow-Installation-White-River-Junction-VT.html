For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from automobile cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray advancement may stream backwards into the potable water system. To secure water quality, backflow protection is required where completion user positions a threat of contaminating the city's supply of water.</p>
