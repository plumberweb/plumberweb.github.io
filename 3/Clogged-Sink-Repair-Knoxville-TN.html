<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in areas where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Tough water reduces the life expectancy of many significant appliances and systems in your house due to the amount of limescale and sediment buildup that happens. Limescale on pipes can trigger deterioration and clogs, which not only reduces the life expectancy of the pipes but puts you in a position where you may have to spend for a costly repair. Accumulation in pipes can also result in a boost of water pressure, which can harm the entire sewer system and considerably increase the opportunities of a pipe rupturing due to tension.</p>
