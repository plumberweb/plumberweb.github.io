Ensure that the softener is filled with salt or potassium chloride following the maker's suggestions.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
