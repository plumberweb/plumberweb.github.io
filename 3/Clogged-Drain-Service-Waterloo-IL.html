For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from automobile cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may stream in reverse into the drinkable water system.
