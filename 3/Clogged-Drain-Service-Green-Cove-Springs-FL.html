<p>When it concerns drains, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of remedy.

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair bill may be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the new heater.</p>
