<p>Before selection and installation, refer to producers literature for temperature level varieties. All assemblies must be secured from freezing temperatures and if set up where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly should be used.

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair costs may be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the new heater.</p>
