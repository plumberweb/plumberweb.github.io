<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
