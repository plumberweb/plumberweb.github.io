The majority of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Generally, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Despite the operating mechanism, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
