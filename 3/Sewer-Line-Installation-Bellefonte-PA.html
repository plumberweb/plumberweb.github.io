<p>Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A waste disposal unit is an important kitchen device in most homes today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can handle nearly any type of food waste, they are not unbreakable. When a fork, bone or other things jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Used impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the danger of drain clogs.</p>
