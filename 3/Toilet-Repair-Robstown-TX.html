<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Demand loads, no matter what their usage, should be fulfilled by a properly sized supply of water, which constitutes the second major part of a supply of water system. With appropriate tank capability to meet variable peak load demand, the water supply source can provide a consistent circulation of water. During hours of low need, the water circulation can be used to refill storage towers, cisterns and tanks, which then supply water for emergency use and durations when demand exceeds the standard pumping rate. A water supply source can take lots of kinds, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or man-made ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
