<p>Pests. Unfortunately, a damaged main sewer line can also result in undesirable pests inside your home.

If you believe you have pests in your plumbing, a plumber can conduct a visual inspection of your sewer line.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
