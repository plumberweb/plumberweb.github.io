<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the external finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
