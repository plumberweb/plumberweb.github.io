<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furnishings to protect them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls.

To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, go in through the ceiling below it. If you want, you can arrange to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel.</p>
