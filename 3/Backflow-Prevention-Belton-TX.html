<p>List prices for house water softeners might vary from around $400 to $2,700, depending on the size and type of softener. Softeners are ranked by the total variety of grains the system can eliminate prior to being recharged. The cost of salt is roughly $5 to $8 per 40-pound bag of salt chloride (NaCl), depending on the kind bought, and approximately $25 per 40-pound bag for potassium chloride (KCl).</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
