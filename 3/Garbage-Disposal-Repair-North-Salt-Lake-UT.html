<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and fulfill our stiff trust certification requirements. A good general rule is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and corroded parts make repairs challenging and expensive, meaning a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the correct fix for concerns such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Toilet repair tends to freak most people out a little, which is completely easy to understand. Nobody wishes to mistakenly break something that might flood their bathroom with raw sewage. However, the majority of toilet repairs are basic and uncomplicated tasks - such as changing a worn flapper - that most people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
