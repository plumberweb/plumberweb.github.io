<p>A continuous-feed garbage disposal is the most common type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating big amounts of food waste. Most garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is more secure to have a vibrating unit come unplugged then disconnected from fixed electrical wiring.

Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
