For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were permitted to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the house. Usually, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>

We have plumbing installation funding readily available to cover those unanticipated water heating repairs or purchases or to prevent your needing to wait to buy required plumbing fixtures.
