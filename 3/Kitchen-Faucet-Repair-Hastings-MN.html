<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Bad Smells - If foul smells are emerging from your drain, this is a clear sign your sink is not effectively draining water. Undesirable smells are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this accumulation accumulates, it can cause more powerful odors, and more serious piping problems. Without practical draining, extreme pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak leading to expensive water damage.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your system is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the brand-new unit in.
