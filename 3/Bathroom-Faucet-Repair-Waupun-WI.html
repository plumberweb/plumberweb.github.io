<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the service with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without solidity ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
