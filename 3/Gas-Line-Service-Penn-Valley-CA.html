<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more brittle and susceptible to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other products are vulnerable to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Specific pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and stress as a result of temperature change and ice development.
