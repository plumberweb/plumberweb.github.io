For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be set up and a practical source of gas established. Another feature of an electric water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated effectively utilizing vents and ducts in order to function properly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
