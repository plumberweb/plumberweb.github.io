<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience blockages in several drains simultaneously in your house, then that normally indicates that your main sewer line is supporting. This can take place in multiple places and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your house, repiping might take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Usually, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal interruption to your everyday regimen. To begin the repiping procedure, the plumbing team will first cover any carpet and furnishings to safeguard them from dust and debris. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and then remove and replace them, leaving as much of the initial building material as possible undamaged.</p>
