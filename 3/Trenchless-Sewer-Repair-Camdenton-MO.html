While most kitchen sink disposers can deal with nearly any type of food waste, they are not unbreakable. When a fork, bone or other item jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can become inefficient, increasing the threat of drain obstructions.</p>
