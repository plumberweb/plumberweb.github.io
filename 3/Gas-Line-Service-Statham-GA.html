<p>No matter whether you need a small toilet repair or a total replacement, we'll do our best to supply you with service as quickly as possible. Bottom line: Tough water can make cosmetic and domestic cleaning products less efficient. This can lead to irritated skin or perhaps a broken washing machine.

<p>Regrettably, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>
<p>House owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage problems. Once a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on particles. Put warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and salt in the waste disposal unit to get rid of grease. Another good technique is utilizing a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>
