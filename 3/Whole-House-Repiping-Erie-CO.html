This really depends on what condition the remainder of the pipes remain in, and how difficult the old system is to remove. In many cases, removal will only add an additional $25 to $50 to the total costs, but sometimes the expenses might be higher if additional pipes need to also be changed.</p>

It is a reasonably easy device that sucks food scraps down into a barbed mill ring that rotates at high speeds, which crushes the scraps. They pass through to the rest of the wastewater to be disposed of when they are little enough. It normally takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be set up on simply one side if you have a duel drain setup.</p>
