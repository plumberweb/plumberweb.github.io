<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions.

Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water turned off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience very little disruption to your everyday routine.
