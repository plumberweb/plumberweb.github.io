<p>Rusty water: If you have rusty water coming out of your faucets, especially if that water is hot, the inside of your unit is most likely rusty. You will likely have to replace your hot water heater if it just happens with hot water. You most likely do not understand what type of pipes you have if you're like most property owners.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
