<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
