<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem became worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really pricey choice.</p>
