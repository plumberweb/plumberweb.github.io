<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
