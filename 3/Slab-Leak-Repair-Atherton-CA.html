<h3>Sink Leaking in Atherton California</h2>
<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to remove chloride.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
