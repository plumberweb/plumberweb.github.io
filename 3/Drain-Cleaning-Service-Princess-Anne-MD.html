<p>Plastic pipe remains in large use for domestic supply of water and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become useful to produce till 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed an approach to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in large usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The method for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have actually ended up being increasingly typical, with a range of products and fittings used.</p>
