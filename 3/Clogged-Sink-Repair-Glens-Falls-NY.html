<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Glens Falls NY</h3>
<p>A lot of houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer finish of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- typically salt. The outcome is water that's been effectively softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>
