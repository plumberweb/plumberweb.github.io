<p>All you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you have actually found the journey lever you desire eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right method.
