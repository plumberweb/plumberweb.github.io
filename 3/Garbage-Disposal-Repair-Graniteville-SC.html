Water pressure might stop working or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
