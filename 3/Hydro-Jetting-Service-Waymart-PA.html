In many cases, removal will just include an extra $25 to $50 to the total costs, however in many cases the expenses could be higher if extra pipes should also be changed.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair bill might remain in the $300 variety.
