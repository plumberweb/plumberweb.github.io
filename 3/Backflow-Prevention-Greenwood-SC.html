<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Greenwood SC</h3>
<p>The majority of houses or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the external finish of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hose pipes: The highly hazardous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company worker had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external house hose bibb (outside spigot). When the supply of water system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through the house into the water supply.</p>
