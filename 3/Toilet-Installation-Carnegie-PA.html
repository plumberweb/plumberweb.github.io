<h3>Water Heater Installation in Carnegie Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as outlined listed below. Both will create an excellent seal (though the gasket might lead to percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is largely a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
