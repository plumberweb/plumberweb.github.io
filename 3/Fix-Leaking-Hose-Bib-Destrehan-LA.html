<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
