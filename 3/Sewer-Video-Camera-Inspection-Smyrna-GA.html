<h3>Blocked Sewer in Smyrna GA 30080 - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
