<h2>Tips To Hire Emergency Plumbing Company in Jacksonville</h2>

Prices depend upon the specific repair needed, where you live, employing a plumber vs. employing a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

Knowing the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be essential.</p>
