<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>No homeowner wants to handle inefficient plumbing, particularly when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your homes plumbing exceeds just the pipes inside your home to the main sewer line that links to them. Many major plumbing problems usually happen on the main line, and it's best to avoid them as much as possible. Harmed sewer lines can result in restrooms flooded with sewage, broken pipes, and pricey repairs.</p>

Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being ineffective, increasing the threat of drain obstructions.</p>
