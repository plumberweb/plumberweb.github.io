<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that must likewise be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and split or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location.
