<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Fallbrook CA 92028</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending on the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>There are several brand names of sink for the kitchen, bath, and utility room, and you can choose from sink products like porcelain or ceramic, enameled stainless-steel, plain stainless-steel, and even plastic. Luckily, all sinks work pretty much the same way, and follow the exact same fundamental design. Candu Pros can service sinks from all the major brands. If you're changing sink hardware like faucets or drains, your Candu Pro can assist with that, too.</p>
