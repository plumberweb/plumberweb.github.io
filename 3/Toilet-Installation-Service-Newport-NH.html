<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are installed in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system.
