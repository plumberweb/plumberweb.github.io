<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
