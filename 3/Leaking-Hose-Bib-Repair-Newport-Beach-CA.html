<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<h3>Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Newport Beach CA 92660</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
