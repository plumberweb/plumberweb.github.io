<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health risk conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just protect versus back siphonage.</p>
