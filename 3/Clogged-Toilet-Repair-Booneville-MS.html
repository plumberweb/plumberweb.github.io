<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
