<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
