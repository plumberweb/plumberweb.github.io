The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
