<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>No matter the kind of plumbing problem, addressing the problem early is essential. However, capturing a gas leak before it becomes a bigger problem is particularly important.
