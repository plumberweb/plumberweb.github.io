<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our stiff trust accreditation standards.

Damaged and corroded parts make repairs difficult and costly, indicating a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the correct fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
