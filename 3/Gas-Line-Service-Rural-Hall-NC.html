<p>Leakages are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

Check Valve Assembly (DC): A DC is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to get in the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
