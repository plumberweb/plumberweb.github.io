<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off.

One way to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
