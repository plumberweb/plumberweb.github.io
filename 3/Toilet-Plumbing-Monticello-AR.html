<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Monticello AR</h3>
<p>Service Teacher's professionals have a long history of repairing home gas lines in Grand Rapids and throughout West Michigan. Our service specialists are extremely rated by our clients. And our happy customers are constantly pleased with the work they receive from our technicians. Gas leak repairs cost $6 to $7 per linear foot or $75 to $150 per hour. Where the leak happens figures out how much the repairs cost. A gas pipe repair to a single device averages between $150 and $650, based upon the range, area, and pipe product.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly cause thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers handle all types of work.
