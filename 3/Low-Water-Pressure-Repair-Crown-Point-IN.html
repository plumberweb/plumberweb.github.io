<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
