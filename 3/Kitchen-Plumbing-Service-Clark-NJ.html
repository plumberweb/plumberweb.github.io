<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
