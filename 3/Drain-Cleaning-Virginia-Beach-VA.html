<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing stoppage service may seem like a waste of cash. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work? While chemical drain cleaners might be a low-cost option, the harsh active ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, with time, developing vulnerable points in the pipe that are most likely to rupture. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
