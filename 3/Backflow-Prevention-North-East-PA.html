<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
