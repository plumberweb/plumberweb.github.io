<p>Seattle Public Utilities checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be tested by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be provided to us. Get cleaner clothing, eliminate rust spots, and utilize less detergent when you soften your laundry water.

We are a leading plumbing company ready to service all of your plumbing needs. We provide a range of specials so you never ever have to pay more. The temperature level and pressure relief valve is a safety device that restricts tank pressure and keeps it from blowing up (Image 4). A new one must be consisted of with every installation. For the valve to work effectively, the discharge pipe need to be kept without obstructions (Fig. A).</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
