<p>Many house owners will notice a clog and right away grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner.

I just recently needed to replace the hot water heater in my house and it was just 6 years old. Traditional hot water heater with a tank must generally last 10 to 15 years. I also have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has not been utilized in more than two years. Washing dishes is my least favorite task, specifically without the aid of a dishwasher.</p>
