I recently needed to replace the hot water heater in my house and it was only 6 years old. Conventional water heaters with a tank ought to generally last 10 to 15 years. I likewise have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has actually not been used in more than two years. Washing meals is my least favorite task, especially without the help of a dishwasher.</p>
