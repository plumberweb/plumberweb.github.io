<p>Leakages are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
