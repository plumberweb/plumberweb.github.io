<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are safe, however over time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
