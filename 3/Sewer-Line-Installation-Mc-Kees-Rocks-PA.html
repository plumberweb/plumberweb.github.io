<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
