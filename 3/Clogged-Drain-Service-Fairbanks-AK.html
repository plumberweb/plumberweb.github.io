<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I find that numerous old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no hint on what they are saying. Because they do not like the technology and not because it does not work, will also say something does not work well simply. If this heater is installed in a house with multiple bathrooms, the piping process contributes to the installation expenses.</p>
<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; recover the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
