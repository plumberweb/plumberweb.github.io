<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Mustang OK</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
