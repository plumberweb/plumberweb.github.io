<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener.

Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
