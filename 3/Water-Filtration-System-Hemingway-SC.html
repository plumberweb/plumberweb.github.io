<p>As soon as in some time, every toilet clogs. How frequently a toilet clogs depends on the strength of its flush, the cleanliness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush.

Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were fantastic. They rapidly found the leak and repaired it without making a big mess.
