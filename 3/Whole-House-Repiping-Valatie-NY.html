<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
<p>As soon as you've discovered the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank.

Remember that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate way. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
