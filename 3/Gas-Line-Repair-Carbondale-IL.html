Instead of requiring to put the waste into the garbage, where it might potentially end up in a garbage dump, garbage disposals let you grind the waste up into tiny particles that can be flushed to the septic tank or sewer.</p>
<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it doesn't always suggest they need to be replaced. Properly maintained pipes might last longer, and badly maintained ones or those in locations with tough water (implying it has high mineral content), may stop working quicker, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life-span estimates.</p>
