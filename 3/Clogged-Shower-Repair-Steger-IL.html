<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
