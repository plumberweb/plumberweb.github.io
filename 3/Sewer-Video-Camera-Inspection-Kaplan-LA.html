<p>If you discover an odor or unpleasant smell originating from your unit, which is not uncommon, consider purchasing a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can get away. These flanges are easy and widely offered to install, costing around $30 at home improvement or hardware shops. Switch off the supply of water to your home at the main line. To avoid leaks from springing during the installation process, shut down the water supply to your home. Ensure your water heater's supply of water is switched off, as is the electricity running to the system.</p>
<p>Before installing, your professional will shut off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is linked to its install. In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up.</p>
