<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>In order to guarantee the proper operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it should be evaluated and certified upon installation and at least as soon as a year afterwards if installed to secure form a health hazard situation. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water providers manage these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that go through fouling, use, or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies have to be evaluated regularly to make sure that they are working effectively. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be tested with appropriately calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
