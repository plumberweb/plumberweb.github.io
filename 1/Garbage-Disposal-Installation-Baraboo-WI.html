Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
