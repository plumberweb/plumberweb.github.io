<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and easy. However discovering the best washer may not be. The most common washers are frequently offered at home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

Sluggish drains: If you notice that your drains are emptying slower, it might be a sign of the early phases of a clog.
