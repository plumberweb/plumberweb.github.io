<p>Next, examine the body. Depending on the size and maker, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again crucial for the repair specialist to be familiar with the firmness of the materials so that their cleaning procedure is not devastating. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to lessen any scale development or rust. It is essential that the repair specialist is delicate to the hardness and type of the different finishes utilized on iron body units so as not to harm the protective finishing.</p>
