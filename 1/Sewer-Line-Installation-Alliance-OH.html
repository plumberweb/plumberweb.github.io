<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>streaming in reverse by obstructing the circulation utilizing drifts or springloaded valves, and (3) vacuum breaker devices vent air from pipe to adjust the pressure and avoid siphonage. These devices are typically combined into single products to increase their effectiveness, such as double check valve assemblies (consisting of two consecutive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure principle backflow preventers (2 inline check valves with a pressure relief valve located between them to dump out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
