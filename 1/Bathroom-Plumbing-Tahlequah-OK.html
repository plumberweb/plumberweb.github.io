<p>Last but not least, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
