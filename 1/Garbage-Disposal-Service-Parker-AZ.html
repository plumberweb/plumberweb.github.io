<p>PEX is made from a versatile piping material that is simple and affordable to install and is resistant to acidic compounds.

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
