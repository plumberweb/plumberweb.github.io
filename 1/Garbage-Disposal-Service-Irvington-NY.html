When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from automobile cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray advancement might flow in reverse into the potable water supply. To safeguard water quality, backflow security is required where completion user positions a risk of polluting the city's water supply.</p>
<p>Building codes can vary from city to city, but all serve the exact same purpose.

<p>Dual Check Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Inspect Valve or double backflow prevention valve is essentially a stripped down Check Valve without turned off valves and test cocks.
