<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
