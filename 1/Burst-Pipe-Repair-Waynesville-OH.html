This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition defense. As the external finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
