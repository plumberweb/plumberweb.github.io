<p>The typical cost of a batch feed waste disposal unit is $100-$ 350 across the country, depending on the size and design.

<p>All you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you've found the trip lever you want eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the appropriate method. When you've protected the trip lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
