<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this short article about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no hint on what they are saying. Will also say something doesn't work well just due to the fact that they do not like the innovation and not because it does not work. The piping procedure adds to the installation expenses if this heater is set up in a house with multiple bathrooms.</p>
