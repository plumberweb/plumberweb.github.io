This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>

Our team is happy to use premium products for results that last, and we are so positive in our services that we offer a three-year service warranty on nearly all tasks.
