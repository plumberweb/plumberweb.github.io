<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Florissant MO</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terminology before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet turned off, appropriately situated test cocks, and the required elements of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each element can further be broken down into its parts. For instance a very first check is a component. A part can even more be broken down into its individual parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are assembled to make parts, and elements are put together to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
