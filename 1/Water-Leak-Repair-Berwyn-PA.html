With minimized energy usage, reduced water consumption, less sewage, and an as needed system, tankless hot water heater are a green alternative to warm water tanks. They conserve energy by only heating the quantity of water needed at a provided minute.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
