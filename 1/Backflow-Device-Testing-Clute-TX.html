<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
