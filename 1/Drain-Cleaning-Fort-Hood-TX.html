If you do not understand, spend the minimal cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, and even dig into and break the line. If you are hiring someone to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the areas to prevent. Your line will be easy to identify if you have a clean-out.</p>
