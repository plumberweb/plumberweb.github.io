<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
