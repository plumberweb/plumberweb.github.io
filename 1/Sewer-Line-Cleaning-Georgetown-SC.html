<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately suffers from rust and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
