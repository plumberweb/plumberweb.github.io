<p>A freshly installed water heater must not produce strange noises, however it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things get worse dramatically for homes with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be necessary.</p>
