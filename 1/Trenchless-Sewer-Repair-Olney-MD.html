<p>In water supply systems, water is generally kept at a considerable pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might be or stop working lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is a suddenly high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>We'll show you three typical gas piping situations. We'll show you one method to make each connection, however there are other equally legitimate methods using typical plumbing parts. Do not be puzzled by the labels FIP and MIP; they merely mean female pipe threads and male pipe threads, respectively. And when you purchase the parts, don't hesitate to request aid. Then screw all the gas line parts together to make sure they fit.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
