<h3>Kitchen Plumbing in Blythewood South Carolina</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have actually accomplished a breakthrough in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Condensation (SACr) technology. SACr physically removes temporary hardness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are major limitations of current softening technologies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it often becomes corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, especially in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green spots being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
