This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
