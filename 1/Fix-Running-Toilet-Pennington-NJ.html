<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Pennington NJ 08534?</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

A water supply source can take many types, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, manufactured or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
