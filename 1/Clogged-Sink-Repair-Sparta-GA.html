<p>When a big adequate source of water has actually been identified and examined, the third major part of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many large cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>
