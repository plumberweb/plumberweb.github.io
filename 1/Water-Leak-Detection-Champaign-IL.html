<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is one of the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health risk or health danger conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only safeguard against back siphonage.</p>
