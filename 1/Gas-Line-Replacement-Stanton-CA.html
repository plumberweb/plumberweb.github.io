I just recently had a number of plumbing leakages fixed and could not be better with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons.

<p>If there is a leak, we will locate the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has actually not already been completed. Then, our specialist will dig to discover the gas line and leak. The gas line will be changed and pressure checked to guarantee there are no leakages. If the leak is effectively repaired, the website will be cleaned up and brought back to its previous elegance.</p>

They get here on time, patiently address all concerns, and go above and beyond to preserve consumer complete satisfaction.
