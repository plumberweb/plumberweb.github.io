That's where underground rain gutter drains are handy. They connect to the downspouts on your house and move water far from the structure underground. Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a process used to clear particles from the side rain gutter pipes on your home.</p>

The biggest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. The majority of big cities need several aqueducts providing water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>
