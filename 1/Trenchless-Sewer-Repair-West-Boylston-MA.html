<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these issues, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While a few of these concerns can be credited to normal wear and tear or improper installation, in some cases your waste disposal unit becomes damaged by items that should not be gone through it.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, however with time they develop and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
