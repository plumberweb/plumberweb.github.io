<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health danger or health threat conditions. They must be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should likewise be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only secure versus back siphonage.</p>
<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a disastrous result on your company. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more tear and use than residential drains and are more susceptible to obstructions and clog. All backflow preventers must be evaluated yearly by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to us.</p>
<p>Bugs. Sadly, a harmed main sewer line can also lead to unwanted pests inside your home. Insects and rats can quickly squeeze through fractures and gaps in your sewer line and discover their way into your plumbing. These pests can be really damaging to your health. A plumber can perform a visual inspection of your sewer line if you suspect you have insects in your plumbing.</p>
