<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in West New York NJ 07093</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>While a Do It Yourself toilet replacement is definitely possible, it's likewise easy to mess up. And when you mess up a toilet installation, you can wind up with big problems: Leakages, ruined floorings, moisture in floor foundations and walls-- expensive and severe problems. Unless you're very experienced, it's best to trust a professional for replacing a toilet.</p>
<p>Testing should be completed by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor must have a valid, up-to-date plumbing license, current insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing certification, and currently adjusted test package. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
