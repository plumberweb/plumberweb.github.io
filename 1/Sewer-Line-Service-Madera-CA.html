If you do not know, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or even dig into and break the line.

<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical.

Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based).

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed.
