<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is.

One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
