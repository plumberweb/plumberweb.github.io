<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals found in water. Typically, minerals arrive since groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water up until it is in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to eliminate liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently eliminated by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers hard water.</p>
