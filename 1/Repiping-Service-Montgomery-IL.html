Black iron pipe is, simply put, the same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with moisture. While it does its job quite well, over time, it still does wear away. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
