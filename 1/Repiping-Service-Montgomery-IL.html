<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with moisture. While it does its job quite well, over time, it still does wear away. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
