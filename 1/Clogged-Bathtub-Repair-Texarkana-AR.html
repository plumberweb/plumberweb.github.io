<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Texarkana AR 71854</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
