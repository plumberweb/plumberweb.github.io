<p>Once you have actually discovered the journey lever you desire, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, make certain you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
