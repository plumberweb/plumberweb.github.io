<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>
