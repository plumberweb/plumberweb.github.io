<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.

I was super pleased with their service.</p>
