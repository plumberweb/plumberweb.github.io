<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they degrade over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to many different types of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from deterioration and may put contaminants into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your home. This might not need completely repiping your house, since more recent materials may have already been utilized in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you identify precisely what work requires to be done.</p>

For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
