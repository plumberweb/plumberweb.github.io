<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
