<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Troy OH</h3>
<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by safeguarding your water-using devices from bad performance and early failure. Some tough water problems are extremely noticeable, like dispensers and sprayers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater elements and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Visible or unnoticeable, these problems have genuine costs related to them. Clogged components cause replacement or reconditioning expenses and can annoy your customers. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy bills, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement costs. Soon, these small expenses can add up to make a genuine effect on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally sodium. The result is water that's been effectively softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>
