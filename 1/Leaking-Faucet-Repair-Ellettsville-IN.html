<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close.
