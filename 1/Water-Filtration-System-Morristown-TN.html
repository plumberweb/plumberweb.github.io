<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation consultation. Setting up natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As difficult water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water stay with the beads, and the treated water heads out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
