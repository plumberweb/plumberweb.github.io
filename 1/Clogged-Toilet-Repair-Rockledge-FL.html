If your showers become frustrating, or it seems little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the house and the number of restrooms and plumbing components-- laundry room, damp bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to get to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your final costs.</p>
<p>During regeneration, the water softener will take the brine solution into the softener tank and the ion exchange procedure occurs once again, just this time in reverse.

<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is simply recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
