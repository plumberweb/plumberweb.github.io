For the most part, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

Difficult water damages home appliances, leaves filmy soap residue across restrooms and kitchens, and dries out hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States depending on tough water for their bathing, cooking, and cleaning, water softeners serve an important function.

Investing in a water softener saves you energy, time, and cash, and protects your house and your residential or commercial property.</p>
