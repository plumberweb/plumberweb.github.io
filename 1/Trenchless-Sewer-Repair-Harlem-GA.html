You may have a concept of where your lateral is situated if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not understand, invest the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even dig into and break the line. If you are employing somebody to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the locations to prevent. Your line will be simple to identify if you have a clean-out.</p>
