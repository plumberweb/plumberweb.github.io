<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
