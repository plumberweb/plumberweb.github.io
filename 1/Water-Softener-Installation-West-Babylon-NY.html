The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage just for non-health threat or health hazard conditions. They must be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours.

It must also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>
