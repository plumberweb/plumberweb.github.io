<p>Leakages are sly. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.
