The largest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many big cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from diverse and geographically apart sources.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
