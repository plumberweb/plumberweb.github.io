<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Redford MI 48239</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
