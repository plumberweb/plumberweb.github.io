<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
