No one wants to walk into a bathroom or a kitchen and find a sink loaded with black gunk.

<p>Before installing, your professional will turn off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new installing ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is hooked up to its mount. In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
