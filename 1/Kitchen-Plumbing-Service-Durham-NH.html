<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Durham NH 03824</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
