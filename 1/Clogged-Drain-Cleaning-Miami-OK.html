<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
