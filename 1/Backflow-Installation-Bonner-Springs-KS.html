<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
