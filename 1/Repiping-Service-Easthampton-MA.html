When gas leakages go overlooked longer than they should, the gas builds up and something as small as an oven burner can burst the entire home into flames. That's not all, a gas leak fire also triggers other gas-run home appliances to explode such as clothing dryer, water heaters, fireplaces, and stoves.</p>
<p>Low Risks: For low threats consisting of fire systems and irrigation systems, City of Bellingham accepts check detector and double check valve assemblies, pressure vacuum breaker assemblies and climatic vacuum breakers as types of protection.
