<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Holly Springs NC</h3>
<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals found in water. Normally, minerals arrive since groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water till it remains in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange procedure to remove dissolved minerals that aren't as effectively gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers hard water.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
