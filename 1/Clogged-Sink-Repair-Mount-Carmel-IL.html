<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its normal circulation. IRWD's potable water supply is developed to keep the water flowing to you.

<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply need backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be eliminated. Backflow assemblies are required to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law likewise needs backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as medical facilities and mortuaries, as well as commercial centers.</p>
<p>A lot of backflow preventers are developed to enable the elements to be eliminated for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system.

Understanding the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
