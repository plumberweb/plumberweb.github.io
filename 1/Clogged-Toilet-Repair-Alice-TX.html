<p>All you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you have actually discovered the journey lever you desire remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
<p>The problem of leakage can be credited to any number of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance.
