Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, along with flexible rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water suppliers supervise these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that go through fouling, wear, or fatigue.

For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies have to be tested regularly to ensure that they are operating appropriately. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have to be checked with appropriately calibrated gauge devices.</p>
