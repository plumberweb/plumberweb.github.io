Water temperature problems can be repaired by changing the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can merely loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
