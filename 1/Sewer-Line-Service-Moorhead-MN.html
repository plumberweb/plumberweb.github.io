<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, but these will be labeled to that result. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

<p>This article intends to attend to the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an appropriately configured water softener does not make the cured water more destructive.
