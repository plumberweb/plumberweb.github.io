If you live in a cold-weather environment, we extremely suggest repiping your house during spring or summer season so you don't need to stress over freezing temperatures during the repiping procedure.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair bill might be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
