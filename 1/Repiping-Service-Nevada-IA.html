<p>A water softener gets rid of minerals that create water firmness, one of the most common water quality problems a homeowner encounters. Hard water damages appliances, leaves filmy soap residue across kitchen areas and bathrooms, and dries out hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States counting on hard water for their cleaning, bathing, and cooking, water softeners serve an important function. A water softener saves you from replacing prematurely messed up water heaters, scaly faucet heads, and hours and hours of tidying up soapy residue.

<p>A few of the causes of drain line obstructions in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a stopping working garbage disposal, or excessive food being disposed down the drain. We will normally suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the severity of the scenario. Provide us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as the majority of plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Appropriate care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
