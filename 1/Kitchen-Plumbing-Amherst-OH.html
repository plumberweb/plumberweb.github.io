<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Amherst OH 44001</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>

After you read Tom's post, see and take a look at its videos All of them are impressive, whether you have an electric or gas heater, and put you on the road to a rapidly-executed repair in no time.

<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
