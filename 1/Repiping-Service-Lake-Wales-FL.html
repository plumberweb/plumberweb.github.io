When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and major leakages. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can really be the less expensive and better long-term service.</p>
