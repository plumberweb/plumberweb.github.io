<h3>Need A Plumber Service Westville IN</h3>
<p>A recently installed hot water heater should not produce unusual sounds, however it will begin to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things intensify drastically for households with a high demand for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>
