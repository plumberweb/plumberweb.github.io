<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
