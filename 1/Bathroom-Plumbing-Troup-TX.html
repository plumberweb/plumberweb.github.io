<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Troup TX</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older unit that's become problematic, or just for a makeover? How about for a building addition or major remodel? Once again, that's something you could do yourself, although it's normally much better to employ a knowledgeable sink plumber in the San Diego area. Installation includes over a lots steps, and removing the old one includes a lot more operations. It can be tough matching up cut outs and fixture holes, and getting the new installation flat and level with everything sealed up.</p>
