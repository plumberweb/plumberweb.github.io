<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Mount Vernon WA</h3>

<p>This post intends to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a properly set up water softener does not make the cured water more corrosive. Here are a couple of complicated truths that frequently lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is normally corrosive. Therefore, softened water must likewise be corrosive, best? This is a misconception since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>

<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). You may not desire to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
