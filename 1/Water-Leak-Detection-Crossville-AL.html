<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is simply recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
