<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically 2 layers of defense. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the structure, however closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect method. There are 2 different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. I discuss them just since they will be on an accreditation test.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
