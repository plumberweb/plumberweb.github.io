<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health danger if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of illness or illness.</p>

Need to replace your existing piping? Call (513) 445-5142 for repiping solutions in Mason.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
