We now have cleaned and examined the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now ready to begin the re-assembly process. Some designs need the parts to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Numerous elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each part is put back into the body, it is essential to put them back in the right location. It is likewise important that as they are positioned back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the components or accidentally positioned in the body. The parts should be put so that the guides are able to keep their designed tolerances.</p>
