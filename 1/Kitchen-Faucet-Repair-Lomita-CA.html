The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas.

Let the mixture sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. If it does not work the very first time, you can duplicate this process.

Typically, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating system, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
