<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working further into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>

Sounds good, doesn't it? What if we informed you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environment-friendly water supply for homes, you can.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
