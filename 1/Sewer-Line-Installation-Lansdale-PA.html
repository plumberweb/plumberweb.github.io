<p>No other room in a house consists of as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Search for quality products when replacing an under-sink assembly. Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, together with versatile rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are a great option s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
