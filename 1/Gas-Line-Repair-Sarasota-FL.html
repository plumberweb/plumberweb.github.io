<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our rigid trust certification requirements. An excellent general rule is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and rusted parts make repairs difficult and expensive, implying a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the proper fix for concerns such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
