<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does happen more frequently than you think! When you don't notice the water was off for a few minutes, typically it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow.
