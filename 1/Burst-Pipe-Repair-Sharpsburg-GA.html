Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would usually cause rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately become broken and need to be replaced.

<p>The anode rod in your water heater is created to attract corrosion-causing aspects in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from corroding.
