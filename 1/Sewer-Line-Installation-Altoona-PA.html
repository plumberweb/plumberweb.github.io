Running the warm water after you've used your sink helps clear debris and separate food and oils and keep your drain clear.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
