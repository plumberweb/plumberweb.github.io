<p>We've currently seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the difference between them?

The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>

<p>The cost of the repair. The basic rule is that if the repair job will cost at least half as much as a new unit, then you must replace it. However, if you're constantly calling us for repairs, the bills can rack up and break previous that price point before you understand it. This kind of valve is normally seen on sprinkler system systems or fire sprinkler systems. There is a ball valve or gate valve assembled on each end. This allows for isolation and testing. Regular and reverse circulation is possible with this valve.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
