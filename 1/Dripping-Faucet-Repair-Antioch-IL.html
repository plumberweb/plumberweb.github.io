If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find among the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
