<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at Fort Valley GA 31030</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
