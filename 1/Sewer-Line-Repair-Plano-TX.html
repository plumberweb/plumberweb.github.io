<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Plano TX</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
