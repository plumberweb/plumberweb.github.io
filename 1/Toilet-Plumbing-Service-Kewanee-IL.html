They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater.

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
