<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively operating RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage must likewise be supplied.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic methods of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The fundamental mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
