<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

If you need a brand-new sink or faucet, compare their costs with what you can find online or at home improvement stores. They might be getting you a better offer</p>
