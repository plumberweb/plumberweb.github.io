<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
