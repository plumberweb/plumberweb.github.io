For a plumber focusing on drain-clearing services, expect to pay a minimum of $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. A lot of problems can be fixed in an hour. For weekend or night calls, add more to the per hour rate.</p>
<p>Once you've found the trip lever you want, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right way. When you have actually secured the trip lever and are ready to link your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
