<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks on-line and off-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
