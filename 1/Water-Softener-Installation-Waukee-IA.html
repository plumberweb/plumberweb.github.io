<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be difficult to spot and can also damage your property. Standing or ponding water from leaking sewer lines are also a health hazard and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also undermine your drain system and trigger separations. Our plumbers often carry out a dye test to identify the source because the source of leaking water can be tough to find. Commonly, pipes or water service lines are changed, only to find they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not always filthy or stained and often gets incorrect for a water supply line leak.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>On-the-job training normally requires working with pipes, waste systems, appliances and components. The technical education hours generally happen at local technical or trade schools.
