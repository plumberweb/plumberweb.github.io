<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Canton IL 61520</h3>
<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be hard to detect and can also harm your property. Ponding or standing water from leaking sewer lines are also a health threat and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also undermine your drain system and cause separations. Our plumbers typically perform a color test to determine the source because the source of leaking water can be hard to discover. Commonly, pipes or water service lines are replaced, only to find they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not constantly dirty or discolored and often gets mistaken for a water supply line leak.</p>
