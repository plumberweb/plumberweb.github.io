<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
