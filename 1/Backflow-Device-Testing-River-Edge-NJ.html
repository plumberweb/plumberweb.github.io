Bio-Clean is an all-natural solution that's both harmless to your plumbing and incredibly effective at removing grime, waste, and organic material that so frequently clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and only partly fixing the issue. Bio-Clean is a service of live germs that actively look for natural material and eat away at it, producing harmless by-products of carbon dioxide, water, and mineral ash, all of which are quickly dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Before setting up, your professional will shut off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is hooked up to its mount. In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
