<p>Tough water use might affect the performance of household appliances. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A large scale accumulation slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, thus affecting their efficiency.</p>

Inspections need to be made after foundation excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon conclusion. NOTE: If faulty work is found, the inspector will release an infraction notice, and a specific amount of time is allotted to remedy the problem.</p>
