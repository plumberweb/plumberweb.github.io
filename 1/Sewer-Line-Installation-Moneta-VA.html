<p>Covert water leaks are frequently demanding and have Potentially Severe Effects. When it rains, any excess water is expected to go down a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems. If you are currently experiencing any flooding on your home when it rains, then there is a good chance that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason needs to be cleared out.

<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if suitable). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in.
