<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally restore after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
