<p>Wanting to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? Lots of blockages are triggered by putting excessive toilet tissue into the bowl. Understand just how much toilet tissue your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush. Never position any paper item into the toilet bowl besides bathroom tissue.
