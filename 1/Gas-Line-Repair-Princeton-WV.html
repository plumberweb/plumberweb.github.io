<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts need to be eliminated and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is essential that just initial factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
