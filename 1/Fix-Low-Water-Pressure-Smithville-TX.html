When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>

Not just do leaking drains cause water damage, they also result in a huge waste of water. A higher-than-normal water expense is typically a sign that you have a plumbing leak somewhere.</p>
