<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Taylors SC</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly trigger countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers deal with all kinds of work. Their duties break out into two categories: Plumbers who deal with standard repairs (frequently in emergency situations), and plumbers who concentrate on remodeling jobs and additions.</p>
