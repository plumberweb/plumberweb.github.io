<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Suffield CT 06078</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
