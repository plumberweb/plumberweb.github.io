It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the salt ions.</p>
