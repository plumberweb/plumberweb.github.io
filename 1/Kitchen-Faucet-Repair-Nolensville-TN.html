<h3>Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Nolensville TN 37135</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring energies or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
