Continuous feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can often get captured in the blades. This can harm the blades and require repairs.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
