<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
