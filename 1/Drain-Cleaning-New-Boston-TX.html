<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are considered a health danger if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be suggested on construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and after that each year.</p>
<p>Additionally, there might be a fracture in the porcelain, either the toilet or the tank bowl itself. Horseshoe Bay rules require that watering systems which do not inject chemicals must have their backflow preventer checked upon installation and then every 5 years afterward.

The backflow prevention assembly need to be dismantled and parts replaced with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated once again to be sure it was correctly fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flowchart is essential to ensure it was fixed effectively. An effectively fixed assembly must offer years of security.</p>
