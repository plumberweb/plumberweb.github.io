<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were enabled to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home. Normally, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>Testing need to be finished by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control workplace. The contractor needs to have a legitimate, current plumbing license, existing insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing certification, and presently calibrated test package. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
