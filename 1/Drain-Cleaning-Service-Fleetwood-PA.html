<p>Responsive flow technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, just one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
