<p>Find the right water softener for you. One common way for a house's water supply to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue might spread greatly. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific homes, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from receding out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
<p>B&I's plumbing department consists of a professional team of licensed plumbers experienced in all elements of commercial and commercial plumbing. We have the resources and experience to take on any task, big or small. From pre-construction planning to post-completion follow up, our plumbing department provides quality installations at competitive rates.</p>
