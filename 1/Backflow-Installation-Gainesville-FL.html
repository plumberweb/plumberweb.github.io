<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
