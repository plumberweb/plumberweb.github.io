<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain San Marcos TX</h3>
<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to go through. The pipes often make odd gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight space. This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, leading to the unusual noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- generally salt. The result is water that's been successfully softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that make up difficult water.</p>
