<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems normally are set up in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
