<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
