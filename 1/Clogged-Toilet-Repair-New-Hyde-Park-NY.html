<p>Leaks - If your water heater is leaking, you may need to replace the system. With time leaks can trigger other issues and even trigger mold to grow around the system. If you observe a leak, get it repaired as soon as you can. Connecting watering to water fountains, swimming pools and garden ponds prohibited: State law and City regulation hold that no watering system may be connected to a fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water functions may only be filled with safe and clean water. Water which has gotten in a watering system is not potable.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it ought to be much less water.</p>
