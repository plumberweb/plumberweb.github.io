<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
