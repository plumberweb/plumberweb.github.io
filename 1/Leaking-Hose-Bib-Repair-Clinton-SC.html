<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities.
