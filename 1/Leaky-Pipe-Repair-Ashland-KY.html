<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any situation that may need a backflow device. Sometimes conditions on homes change that may need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your business, they can trigger monetary losses and in some circumstances can stop your service totally. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a small office the concerns brought on by even small drain problems can cause significant concerns.</p>
<p>The normal service is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually experiences rust and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
