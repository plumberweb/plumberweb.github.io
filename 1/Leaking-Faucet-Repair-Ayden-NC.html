<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
