Jeff Gorton, an editor at The Household Handyman, will show you how to eliminate and get rid of of a hot water heater in our video tutorial. He will also show you the simple method to bring a water heater out of your home, even if you are working alone.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Certainly, sometimes, you may want to replace your toilet in favor of a low-flow design or the like.
