<h3>Drain Cleaning in Shepherd TX 77371 : What You Need To Know?</h3>

The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
