<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Ballston Lake NY</h3>
<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by securing your water-using equipment from poor performance and premature failure. Some tough water problems are extremely visible, like sprayers and dispensers becoming clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater components and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Undetectable or noticeable, these problems have genuine costs associated with them. Clogged components cause replacement or reconditioning costs and can annoy your clients. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy bills, and too soon harmed RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement expenses. Soon, these small costs can add up to make a real effect on your bottom line.</p>
<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, specifically when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
