When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the water system, there is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply.
