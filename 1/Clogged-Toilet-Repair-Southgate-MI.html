<p>Never attempt a repair or waste disposal unit installation on your own. Constantly trust a professional to reduce the opportunities of injury. Your house is over 10 years old, and you have actually never had the sewer and drain lines inspected. Some plumbers might get professional discounts from retailers or kitchen and bath display rooms. Compare their expenses with what you can find online or at home improvement stores if you need a new sink or faucet. They might be getting you a better deal</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
