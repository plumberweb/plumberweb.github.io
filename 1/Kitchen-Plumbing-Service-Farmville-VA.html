<p>The issue of leak can be credited to any number of elements which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes location. The thermal expansion requires to leave, thus the need for an expansion tank to assist regulate the pressure.
