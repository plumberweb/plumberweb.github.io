<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
