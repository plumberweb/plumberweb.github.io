<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least pricey of the backflow prevention choices, but they likewise supply the least amount of security. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, likewise known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. This disc rises and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to permit air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>DCVs are particularly developed to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The mainstay for normal fire defense applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 independently operating spring-loaded check valves (normally inside a single valve body), four test cocks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals begin around $500-$ 2,500 and increase depending on size, brand name and features.</p>
