<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>In fact, reverse flow testing designed to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow remains a legitimate health concern, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are effectively tested by certified workers.</p>
