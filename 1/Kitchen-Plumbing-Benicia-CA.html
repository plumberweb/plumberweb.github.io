The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
