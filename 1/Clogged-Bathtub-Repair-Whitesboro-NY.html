<p>For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can cause deterioration that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and removes from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
