If your house is over 50 years old, it's a good bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000.

<p>The typical time to replace a garbage or install disposal ranges from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour.
