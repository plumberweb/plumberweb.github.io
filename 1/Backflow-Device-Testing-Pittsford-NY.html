<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
