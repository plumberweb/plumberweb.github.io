Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
