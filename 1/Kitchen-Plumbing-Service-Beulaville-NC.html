Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
