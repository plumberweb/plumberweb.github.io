<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques at Middletown RI 02842</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
