<p>The majority of demand for plumbers will originate from new building and construction and the need to keep and repair plumbing systems in existing residences and other structures. Employment of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to embrace modifications to constructing codes that require the use of fire suppression systems. It's likely that the new unit will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal attached to the sink already. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by getting rid of the old drain. Most drains are connected to the sink by a big nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
