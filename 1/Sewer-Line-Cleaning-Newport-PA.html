<p>The usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
