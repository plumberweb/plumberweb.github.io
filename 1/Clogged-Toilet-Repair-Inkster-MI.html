<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
