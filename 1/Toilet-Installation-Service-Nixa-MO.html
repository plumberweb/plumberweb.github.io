<p>Last but not least, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in important locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
<p>The cost of having your backflow preventer checked differs based upon your place and the companies you may select from.
