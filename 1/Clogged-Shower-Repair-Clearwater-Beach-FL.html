<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Bad Odors - If nasty smells are emerging from your drain, this is a clear sign your sink is not appropriately draining water. Undesirable stinks are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this accumulation builds up, it can lead to more powerful smells, and more serious piping problems. Without functional draining, excessive pressure can trigger your piping system to break and leak resulting in costly water damage.</p>
<p>The anode rod in your hot water heater is created to bring in corrosion-causing components in the water, assisting to prevent the steel tank from rusting. The best method to prevent drain obstructions is to see what you flush. If you look at your house's plumbing pipes and see discolorations, discoloration, flaking, small indentations or rust, your pipes are rusting. Corroding pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they haven't already) and should be changed as quickly as possible.</p>
