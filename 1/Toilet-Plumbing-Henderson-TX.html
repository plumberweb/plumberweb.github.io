<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the faulty pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately experiences rust and does not have the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
