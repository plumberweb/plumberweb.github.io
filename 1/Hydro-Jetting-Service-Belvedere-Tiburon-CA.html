<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have accomplished a development in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically eliminates momentary solidity without using chemicals or high pressure, which are major restrictions of current softening innovations.</p>
<p>The water used to regrow the softener beads winds up as waste.

These are scenarios that can quickly be prevented, as long as correct maintenance is performed.
