Without practical draining pipes, excessive pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak leading to pricey water damage.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by connecting a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may provide a quick fix in the short-term, it can trigger even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. A great location to start trying to find the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is below the puddle of water or where you appear to feel the dampness most.</p>
