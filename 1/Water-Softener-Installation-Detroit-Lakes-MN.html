There is a leak someplace and this could be major problem if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in the house should have water. This chooses every other shut off valve and their corresponding faucets. If whatever is working appropriately, you are off to an excellent start.</p>
