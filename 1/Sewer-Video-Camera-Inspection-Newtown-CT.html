<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some houses were permitted to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the home. Usually, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
