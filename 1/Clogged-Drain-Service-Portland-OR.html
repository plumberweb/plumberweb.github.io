Idea: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are deteriorating gradually from the inside. In most cases, repiping is your only practical alternative.</p>
