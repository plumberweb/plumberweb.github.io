<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

The only difference is the quantity of water they can heat up at any offered time. Also, whole-house systems are substantially more pricey than the point of use systems.</p>
