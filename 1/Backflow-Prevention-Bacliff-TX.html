This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the external finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
