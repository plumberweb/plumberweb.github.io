<p>If you see an odor or undesirable smell coming from your system, which is not unusual, think about buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can get away. These flanges are easy and widely offered to install, costing around $30 at home enhancement or hardware stores. Shut off the water supply to your house at the main line. To prevent leakages from springing throughout the installation process, turned off the water system to your home. Make sure your hot water heater's water supply is shut off, as is the electricity running to the unit.</p>
