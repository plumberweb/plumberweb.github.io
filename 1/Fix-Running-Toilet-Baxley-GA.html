<h3>Do You Need Water Heater Repair in Baxley GA 31513?</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>In reality, reverse flow testing designed to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow remains a genuine health issue, it considers avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are appropriately evaluated by certified personnel.</p>
