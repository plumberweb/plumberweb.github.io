<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Oil City PA 16301</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>You also need to buy a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual circulation, taste, odor or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure may need replacing the water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
