<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
