Your flow rate will continue to limit and you risk losing water pressure throughout the home if scale continues to build up in your pipes. Tough water ravages water heaters, and without a softener, your energy expenses will continue to barrel skyward. The perpetual cycle of repairs and replacements will continue until your house is safeguarded by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
