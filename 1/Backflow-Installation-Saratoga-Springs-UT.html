<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
