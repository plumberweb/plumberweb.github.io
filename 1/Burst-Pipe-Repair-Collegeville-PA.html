<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>

Corrosion can literally eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or modify the tolerances triggering parts to not work in a backflow preventer. The effect of rust on a metal alloy should be examined to identify if the part is usable or should be changed.</p>
