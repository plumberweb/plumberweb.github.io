<p>When you depend on Roto-Rooter for water heater maintenance, replacement or repair, you can anticipate professional service from skilled plumbing experts. Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to flow in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, drinkable water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water backwards into the water system. For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may flow in reverse into the potable water supply.
