Most of the Valley in reality has some of the worst water in the country. We rank 3rd for the absolute worst water in the country according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do live in a desert after all. In fact the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even drink has a chlorine level that is perfect for pool. We have 300% more chemicals that exceed nationwide health standards, and a even high percentage of toxins in our water that the national average. On top of that our average water hardness level is between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simpleness reasons "very tough water".</p>
