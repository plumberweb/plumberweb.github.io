<p>Culpeper House Services provides professional garbage disposal solutions throughout Culpeper County.

For double-bowl sinks, the very best way to go about things is to use a continuous waste disposer kit including a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such sets direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the location of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet set.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
