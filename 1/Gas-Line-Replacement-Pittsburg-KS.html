Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>

The backflow prevention assembly must be dismantled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be tested again to be sure it was properly repaired. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is needed to ensure it was fixed correctly. A correctly repaired assembly ought to provide years of protection.</p>
