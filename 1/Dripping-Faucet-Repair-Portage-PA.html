Repeating repairs and leakages. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run.

<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
