<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and relies on a good balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently. If your showers end up being disappointing, or it seems little to no water is draining of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the house and the variety of restrooms and plumbing fixtures-- laundry room, wet bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to access to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your last costs.</p>
