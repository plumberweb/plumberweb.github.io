During regrowth, salty water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>If you have checked out the paragraph above, you now understand that there various mechanical parts within your toilet's tank that allow your toilet to flush the water down the toilet bowl.

Since they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened.
