<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>A review of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly must then be examined. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that could cause false information on the operations of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to extreme pressure spikes that might damage parts. The results of raised temperature can also cause extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the components. These and other unfavorable impacts from the hydraulic conditions need to be recognized and their cause remedied. If parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not fixed, the brand-new parts can soon be made inoperative.</p>
