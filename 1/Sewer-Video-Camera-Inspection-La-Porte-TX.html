<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furniture to protect them from water damage and dust during the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will just eliminate as much structure material as needed to reach, detach, and remove the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, go in through the ceiling below it. You can organize to have actually extra pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel if you wish.</p>
