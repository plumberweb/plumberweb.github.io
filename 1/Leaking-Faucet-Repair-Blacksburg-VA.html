<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Blacksburg VA</h3>
<p>A newly set up water heater must not produce unusual noises, but it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat the water. Things aggravate drastically for families with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be necessary if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
