<p>When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might require slightly different steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
