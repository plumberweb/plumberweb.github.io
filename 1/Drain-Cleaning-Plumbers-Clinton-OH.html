Ponding or standing water from leaking sewer lines are also a health hazard and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also weaken your drain system and cause separations. Since the source of leaking water can be hard to discover, our plumbers often carry out a color test to determine the source. Typically, pipes or water service lines are changed, only to find they were not the source of a leak.
