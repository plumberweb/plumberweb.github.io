That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other devices. Even your water lines must be covered.

<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule.
