<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they weaken over decades.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous.

Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
