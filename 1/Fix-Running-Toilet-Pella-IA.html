<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is.

So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
