Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
