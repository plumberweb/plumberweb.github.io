If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet).
