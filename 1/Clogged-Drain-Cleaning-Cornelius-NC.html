Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
