<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>There are two types of water softeners, a salt based water softener and a salt-free water softener Salt based water softeners will offer you more of the slick" sensation in the shower and you will notice the soap developing more bubbles. Other advantages you will see consist of brighter colors in your clothes, minimized scale accumulation on your showers and softer skin.</p>
