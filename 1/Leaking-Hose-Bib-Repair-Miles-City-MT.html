<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
