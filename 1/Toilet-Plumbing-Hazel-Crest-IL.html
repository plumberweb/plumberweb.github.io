<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater maintenance, replacement or repair, you can anticipate professional service from proficient plumbing experts. Backflow prevention devices operate by permitting water to flow in just one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a structure or fixture.

For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from automobile cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may flow in reverse into the safe and clean water system.
