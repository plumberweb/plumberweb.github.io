One typical way for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.

Loss of hair when taking a shower is a standard issue when it concerns clogged drains in the bathroom, and pieces of food and grease are a typical problem in the kitchen.
