<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending on the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again crucial for the repair professional to be aware of the solidity of the materials so that their cleaning process is not destructive. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to decrease any scale development or deterioration. It is essential that the repair professional is sensitive to the hardness and kind of the different coatings utilized on iron body systems so as not to damage the protective finish.</p>

According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The mean per capita water use daily is higher in rural counties than urban counties in all the climate areas, except in the Central and Southeast regions"1 with backwoods having less efficient supply of water systems2 mainly due to the relative lack of financial resources to update and keep their systems. So, the greater per capita usage" of water in backwoods might consist of considerable non-revenue water losses from their distribution pipelines.
