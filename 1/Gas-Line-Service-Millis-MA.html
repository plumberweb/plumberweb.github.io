<p>When compared to gas designs, electric designs are much easier and less expensive to install as electricity is currently available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line has to be installed and a practical source of gas established. Another feature of an electric hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated effectively utilizing vents and ducts in order to function properly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
