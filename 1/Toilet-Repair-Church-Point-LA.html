Plus an easy-to-use Days to Empty feature allows you to monitor when a salt refill is needed.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
