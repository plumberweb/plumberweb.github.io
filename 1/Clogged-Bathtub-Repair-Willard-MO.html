<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
