<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Dover OH</h3>
<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
