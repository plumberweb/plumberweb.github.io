<p>When you eliminate the cap to eliminate the valve, check the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is cheap and simple. However finding the right washer might not be. The most common washers are typically available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
