It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly.
