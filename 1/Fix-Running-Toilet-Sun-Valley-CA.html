<p>It's Making sounds - As your water warms, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can develop noise. If your energy bills are rising, a new, higher effectiveness water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, enabling difficult water to flow to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its brand-new area and put there.</p>
