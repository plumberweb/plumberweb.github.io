<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
