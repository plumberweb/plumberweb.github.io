<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite direction. You might be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the exact same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc finishing on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with moisture. While it does its task pretty well, gradually, it still does corrode.

<p>To connect a power cord to the new system, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cable, using wire nuts.
