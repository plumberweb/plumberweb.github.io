Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals.

This can cause low flow concerns and even stop a fixture from flowing altogether.

<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water functions are considered a health risk. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location need to be suggested on construction plans.
