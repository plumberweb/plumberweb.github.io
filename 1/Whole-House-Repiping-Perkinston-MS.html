<p>No other room in a home includes as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Search for quality materials when changing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, in addition to flexible rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are a good option s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
