<p>Strange Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to go through.

This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, resulting in the odd noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be replaced.
