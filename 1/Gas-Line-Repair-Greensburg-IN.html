If your energy bills are rising, a brand-new, higher performance water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, enabling hard water to flow to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, transferred to its brand-new area and put there.</p>
