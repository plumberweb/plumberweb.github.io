<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
