<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
