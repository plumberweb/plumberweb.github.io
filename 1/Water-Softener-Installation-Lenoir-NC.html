<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Lenoir NC 28645</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
