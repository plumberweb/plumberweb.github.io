Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low.

<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually salt or often potassium).</p>

<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time associated. If everything is ready, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours required and for that reason the overall expenses. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
