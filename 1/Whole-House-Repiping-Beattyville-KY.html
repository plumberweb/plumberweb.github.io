<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>

All that has to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, permitting tough water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its brand-new place and placed there.</p>
