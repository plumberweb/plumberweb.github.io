Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is just capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>

Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
