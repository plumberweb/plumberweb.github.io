This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
