<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back since he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>House owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage issues. Once a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on debris. Pour warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice cubes and table salt in the waste disposal unit to eliminate grease. Another excellent trick is using a drain strainer to keep out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
