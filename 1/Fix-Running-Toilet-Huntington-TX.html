<p>Upon earning a high school diploma or GED, potential plumbing contractors need to begin a plumbing apprenticeship. Apprentice programs are the most common method for plumbers to discover the abilities required to become successful in the trade. Most apprenticeships are sponsored by local unions, companies or contractor organizations. Programs normally last four to five years and require apprentices to complete a certain number of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
