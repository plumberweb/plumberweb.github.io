Howard, the Task Manager, has actually always been handy and useful concerning all our concerns. He did the proposal and arranged the work for the clean out and partial sewer line repair promptly. It is constantly a satisfaction to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He had the ability to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is always enjoyable, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. You may need to change toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is fairly new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing info.
