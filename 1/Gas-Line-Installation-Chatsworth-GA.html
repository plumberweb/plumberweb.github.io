When the water is very tough and it is used greatly, the expenses of softening will rise.</p>

When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated effectively. If the bypass valve is broken, it can also trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or replaced in time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration procedures. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is most likely split and just needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
