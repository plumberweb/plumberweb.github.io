The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system.

<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly working RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be offered.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
