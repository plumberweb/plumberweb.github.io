<p>In water system systems, water is generally preserved at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
