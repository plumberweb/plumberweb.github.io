<p>Building codes can vary from city to city, but all serve the same function. The extensive list of provisions and guidelines note the minimum requirements for the design and building of a commercial or residential building. Structures that don't adhere to local code are thought about risky and require an update. In extreme cases, it's much better to destroy old structures instead of spending the time and cash on pricey repairs or replacements.</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if essential. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Many people are reluctant to use water softening systems due to the fact that they may be under the impression that the equipment regrows rather often and puts a high load of sodium salts into the drainage. This, obviously, is not true; the typical household of 4 people would require entire house water softener regrowth around two or three times a week.</p>

The backflow prevention assembly should be disassembled and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be checked once again to be sure it was properly repaired.
