Having a plumbing inspection is quite standard when purchasing a house or flat. If it's a leasing I have actually not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In reality, if not done it can be among the most costly repair jobs if ignored. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is an issue, you may need all of your water piping changed. Once again, extremely expensive. This is simply among lots of issues that can surface.</p>

<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
