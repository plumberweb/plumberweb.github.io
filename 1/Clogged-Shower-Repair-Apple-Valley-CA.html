<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your water heater installation appointment. Setting up natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As hard water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause hard water stay with the beads, and the treated water goes out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
<p>The problem of leakage can be attributed to any number of elements which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes location. The thermal growth needs to escape, thus the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. The force exerted by the expansion taking place when boiling the water triggers the tank to break and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
