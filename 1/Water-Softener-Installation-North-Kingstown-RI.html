It should likewise be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just protect versus back siphonage.</p>
