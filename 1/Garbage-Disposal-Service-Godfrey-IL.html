<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>

There are numerous combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your house.</p>

Therefore, all backflow prevention assemblies have to be evaluated occasionally to ensure that they are operating correctly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have to be evaluated with appropriately adjusted gauge devices.</p>
