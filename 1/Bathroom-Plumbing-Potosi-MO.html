<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program safeguards the general public supply of water from pollutants and contaminants that could, under certain scenarios, be drawn into the general public water supply from private properties. If you need a brand-new toilet, the cost mostly depends upon the toilet you choose. Toilets differ in design, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more pricey than others. When setting up a new toilet, the plumber may also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the task.</p>
