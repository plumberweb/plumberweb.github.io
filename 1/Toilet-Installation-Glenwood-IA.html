<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and blended with water. , if you prepare to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
