<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
