No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does happen more frequently than you think! Frequently it occurs in the evening when you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes construction tasks easily the most typical cause of backflow problems.
