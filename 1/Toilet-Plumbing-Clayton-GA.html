<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey choice.</p>
