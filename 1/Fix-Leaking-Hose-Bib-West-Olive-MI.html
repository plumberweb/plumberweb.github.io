<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber West Olive MI</h3>
<p>Bought happy medium stainless-steel blade model available at Lowes. Got a small local plumber who overcharged me, I think. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. brand-new $25 strainer for the sink. Approx. 1 hour work for 2 guys. There are numerous reasons why you may need to call a plumber to come to your home and unclog drains. No matter what the cause of your concern, our drain cleaning service specialists will take care of you as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
