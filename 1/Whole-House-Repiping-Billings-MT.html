<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Billings MT</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
