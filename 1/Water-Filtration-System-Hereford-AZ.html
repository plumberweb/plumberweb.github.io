This is an option to consider if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually struggles with deterioration and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
