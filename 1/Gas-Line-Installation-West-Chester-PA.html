When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately. If the bypass valve is cracked, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed over time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration procedures. A used water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is most likely broken and merely needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
