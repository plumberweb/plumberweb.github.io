This can happen in several places and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your house.</p>
