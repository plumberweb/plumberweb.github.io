<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
