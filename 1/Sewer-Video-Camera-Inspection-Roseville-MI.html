<p>Leaks are sly. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Re-piping is a procedure of replacing the supply pipes in a house or business. It is not a temporary fix or a replacement of short areas of pipe, but a total replacement of your supply plumbing system.

If you are going to redesign it is a great time to repipe before you paint or complete your walls.  It is important to understand the scope of the project before work is begun.
