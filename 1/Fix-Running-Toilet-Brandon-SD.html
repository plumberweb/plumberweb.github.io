<p>Once you have actually discovered the trip lever you want, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right way. When you've secured the trip lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, ensure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
