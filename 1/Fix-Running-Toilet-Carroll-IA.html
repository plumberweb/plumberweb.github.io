<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
