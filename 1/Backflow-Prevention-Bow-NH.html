<p>Plastic pipe remains in wide use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being practical to produce up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a technique to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe started to be manufactured in the 1940s and remained in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was likewise established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have ended up being progressively typical, with a range of fittings and materials employed.</p>
<p>The typical service is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, but steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
