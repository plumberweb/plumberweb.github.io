<p>Great deals of bad things are being stated on this post about liners. I find that lots of old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are stating. Due to the fact that they do not like the innovation and not because it doesn't work, will also state something does not work well merely. The piping process includes to the installation costs if this heater is installed in a house with several restrooms.</p>
