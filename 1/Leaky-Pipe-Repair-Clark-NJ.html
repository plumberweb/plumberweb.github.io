<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a properly operating RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must likewise be provided.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be changed. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
