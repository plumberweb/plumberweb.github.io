<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
