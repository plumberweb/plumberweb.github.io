These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
