We suggest getting your house or office inspected for gas leaks every year, or the minute you suspect that a leak has taken place. A gas leak can cause a fire, and even an explosion, or cause physical stress on the body that leads to headaches, tiredness, dizziness, irritation to eyes and throat, chest discomforts, sounding in the ears, nosebleeds, and more. In truth, Carbon monoxide gas poisoning is a common result of unattended gas line repair jobs. Outside of bodily harm, gas line leakages can also cause serious damage to your pipes, implying more of your hard-earned cash invested in repairs.</p>
