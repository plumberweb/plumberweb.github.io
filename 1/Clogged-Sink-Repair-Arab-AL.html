<p>When a big sufficient source of water has been recognized and evaluated, the third major part of a water system system enters into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The largest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. The majority of large cities need numerous aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
