<p>The problem of leak can be attributed to any variety of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the growth that takes location. The thermal growth needs to escape, hence the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force put in by the expansion happening when boiling the water triggers the tank to crack and begin leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
<p>Local laws require yearly inspections to ensure your backflow prevention devices are working as they should be since water contamination could pose a serious public health risk. Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that wear out with time and it's important that they receivethe very same regular maintenance that your car or HVAC system gets to ensure your family's water is clean & safe.</p>
