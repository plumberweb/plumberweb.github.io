That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can develop noise.

Our whole-house systems resolve common water problems such as tough water, water staining, chlorine taste and odor, dry skin, and dry hair.
