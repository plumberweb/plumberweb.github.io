<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
