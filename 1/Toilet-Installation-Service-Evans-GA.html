<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Pictures supplied by the American Backflow Prevention Association. The cost to repipe a home with copper pipe is between $8,000 and $16,000 or about $3 to $8 per linear foot.
