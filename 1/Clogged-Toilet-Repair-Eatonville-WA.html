<p>Sinkholes don't only occur in your backyard, sadly, when a sewer line breaks. If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running beneath your house's structure, the best you can expect is to find out rapidly. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out underneath your home, a sinkhole will trigger the structure to move and establish fractures. In this case, you'll need professional plumbers as well as foundation repair professionals.</p>
