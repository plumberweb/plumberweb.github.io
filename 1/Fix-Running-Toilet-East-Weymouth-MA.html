<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors East Weymouth MA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
