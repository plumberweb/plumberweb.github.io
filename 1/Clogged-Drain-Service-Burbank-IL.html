<p>Double Examine Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Inspect Valve or double backflow prevention valve is basically a stripped down Check Valve without shut down valves and test dicks. They are non-testable and are typically used by water companies and installed after a water meter to avoid the meter from running in reverse and low security against backflow. This piece of equipment is the center of debate with many backflow authorities and should never ever be confused with Double Check Valves. Contact local authorities for needed installation, as a lot of do not acknowledge these as backflow prevention devices.</p>

An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be gotten rid of and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is essential that just initial factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
