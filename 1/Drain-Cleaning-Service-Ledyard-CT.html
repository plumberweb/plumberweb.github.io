<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Ledyard CT 06339</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>Depending on the size of your house, repiping may take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Generally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water shut down while you are out and about during the day, so you experience very little interruption to your day-to-day regimen. To start the repiping procedure, the plumbing group will initially cover any carpet and furniture to protect them from dust and particles.
