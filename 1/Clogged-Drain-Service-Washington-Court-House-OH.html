They must be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to likewise be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only safeguard versus back siphonage.</p>
