<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation instructions within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
