<p>Given that the pipes are easier to gain access to and replace, it costs less to do the work and takes less time.

<p>Dual Inspect Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Check Valve or double backflow prevention valve is generally a disrobed Double Check Valve without shut off valves and test cocks. They are non-testable and are normally used by public utility and set up after a water meter to prevent the meter from running in reverse and low protection against backflow. This tool is the center of controversy with many backflow authorities and should never ever be confused with Check Valves. Consult local authorities for needed installation, as most do not acknowledge these as backflow prevention devices.</p>

<h3>Blocked Drains in Irmo SC 29063 - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
